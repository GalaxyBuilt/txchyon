I installed gated code blurs the words after certin point or fully but still alllows gooogle bots to crawl 
for SEO and RANKING Traffic will come but they must subscribe to newsletter to view gateed material still
free no charging but you pay with a email $0 still....  This business model I thought I came up with it, but
its called the velvet rope strategy.  Or Soft Gate 

free + gated content in the same article 40% free 60% gated 

"isAccessibleForFree": "true",  // Whole article
"hasPart": {
  "isAccessibleForFree": "false"  // Gated section
}

and 

Full gated no can see any of the article 

"isAccessibleForFree": "false"
❌ Don't use this - This tells Google the entire article is behind paywall


// Googlebot sees:
<div class="locked-content">
  Step 1: Connect your wallet...  // ✅ FULLY VISIBLE TO BOTS
  Step 2: Deposit USDC...         // ✅ FULLY VISIBLE TO BOTS
</div>

// Users see (with CSS blur):
<div class="locked-content" style="filter: blur(12px);">
  Step 1: Connect your wallet...  // ❌ BLURRED FOR USERS
  Step 2: Deposit USDC...         // ❌ BLURRED FOR USERS  
</div>


Because I have top authority strategy with clusers using "false" on article 4-5 fully gated won't hurt the seo because the 123 article is fully free gaining views and sending traffic to 4 and 5

so 

option 1 normal schema 

don't include in schema for fully free highest SEO
---
title: "Free Guide for SEO"
# No isFullyGated or hasGatedContent needed
---

All content is free and will rank well

option 2 

partially gated content schema

---
title: "Hybrid Guide"
hasGatedContent: true
gateType: 'partial'
---

Free intro content...

<GatedContent>
Premium steps here...
</GatedContent>

option 3 full conversion mode 

fully gated schema

---
title: "Premium Checklist"
isFullyGated: true
---

<GatedContent>
All content is gated...
</GatedContent>


updated gated logic

// ======================
// DUAL GATE CONTROL: Frontmatter + Hardcoded Backup
// ======================

// Hardcoded backup array (for testing/emergencies)
const hardcodedGatedArticles = [
  '/blog/airdrop-farming/airdrop-disqualification-risks',
  // Add more URLs here if needed
];

const currentPath = Astro.url.pathname;

// Method 1: Frontmatter (primary)
const fromFrontmatter = Astro.props.hasGatedContent === true;

// Method 2: Hardcoded backup
const fromHardcoded = hardcodedGatedArticles.includes(currentPath);

// Final decision: Gate if EITHER method says yes
const hasGatedContent = fromFrontmatter || fromHardcoded;

console.log('🎯 GATE CONTROL:', {
  path: currentPath,
  frontmatter: fromFrontmatter,
  hardcoded: fromHardcoded,
  final: hasGatedContent
});

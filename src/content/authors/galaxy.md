Founder of Txchyon Capital & Txchyon Labs

Full-time trader turned institutional-grade trading systems developer, operating at the intersection of DeFi, perpetuals, and long-term digital asset positioning.

Txchyon began as a private on-chain research operation built around real capital and real execution. Over time, that edge evolved into something larger — the engineering of systematic trading infrastructure and the creation of an educational platform designed to raise the standard of crypto intelligence globally.

Every insight published is grounded in live market experience, structured frameworks, and systems built from the front lines — not theory.

Galaxy represents the operator behind the research: a trader who chose to build the tools he wished existed.

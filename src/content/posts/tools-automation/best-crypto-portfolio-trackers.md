Keeping track of multiple wallets, DeFi positions, and NFTs can be overwhelming — especially if you’re using **multiple exchanges or wallets**.

Crypto portfolio trackers solve this problem by:
- Aggregating balances from multiple wallets and exchanges
- Showing real-time PnL (profit and loss)
- Visualizing DeFi and NFT holdings
- Alerting you to major changes

This guide covers:
- Why portfolio trackers are essential
- Types of trackers available in 2026
- The best portfolio trackers for beginners and advanced traders
- How trackers tie into trading bots and analytics tools

## Why Use a Crypto Portfolio Tracker?

Manual tracking is inefficient and prone to mistakes:
- Copy-pasting balances
- Forgetting token allocations
- Missing NFT or DeFi positions

Portfolio trackers provide:
- **Real-time monitoring** of all wallets
- Consolidated overview of token allocation
- Performance history for analytics
- Integration with alerts and automation tools

Without a tracker, even advanced traders risk **losing sight of their actual holdings**, which can affect trading decisions and risk management.

## 📌 Introduction — Why Audit-Ready Accounting Matters

If you’re running a crypto business, keeping clean financial records isn’t just good practice — it’s **mandatory for compliance**.  

Auditors, tax authorities, and investors all expect:

- Accurate tax reporting  
- Organized accounting books  

Without this, audits can turn stressful, and penalties can get expensive.

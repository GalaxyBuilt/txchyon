Even if you’re just holding Bitcoin or swapping a few tokens on Solana, every transaction can count as a taxable event. The good news: you don’t need a law degree to figure this out — you just need the right guidance and tools.  

In this guide, we’ll cover:  

- What counts as a taxable event  
- How to calculate your gains and losses  
- The best tools to automate crypto tax reporting  
- How businesses can stay compliant without losing their minds  

And yes, we’ll **link to authoritative sources** so you know we’re not just guessing here.

## 🧾 Section 1: What Triggers a Taxable Event

Crypto taxation can be confusing because **not every movement is taxable**, but here’s the rule of thumb: if you “dispose” of crypto, it usually counts.  

### 🔹 Examples of Taxable Events

- **Selling crypto for fiat:** ETH → USD  
- **Swapping one crypto for another:** ETH → SOL  
- **Using crypto to buy stuff:** paying for a laptop with BTC  
- **Staking rewards:** earned from PoS networks  
- **Mining income:** coins received from mining  
- **Airdrops and token incentives:** if they have monetary value  

**Sources:**  
- IRS: [Virtual Currency Guidance](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/frequently-asked-questions-on-virtual-currency-transactions)  
- ATO: [Cryptocurrency and Tax](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Bus/Understanding-crypto-currency-and-tax/)  
- HMRC: [Cryptoassets Manual](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual)  

> Quick tip: Even if the value is tiny, technically it’s reportable. Don’t ignore it.  

---

### 🔹 What Doesn’t Usually Count

- Sending crypto between **your own wallets**  
- Transferring coins to a **custodial account**  
- Holding crypto in an exchange **without trading**  

The IRS calls this “non-taxable transfers,” and it’s the same idea in other countries, but **always keep good records**.

## 🔹 Section 2: Cost Basis and Capital Gains

Here’s where people’s heads spin. **Cost basis** is basically how much you paid for the crypto. Every time you sell or swap, you need to figure out your **gain or loss**:

Gain/Loss = Fair Market Value at Disposal - Cost Basis


### 🔹 Methods to Track Cost Basis

- **FIFO (First In, First Out):** oldest coins sold first  
- **LIFO (Last In, First Out):** newest coins sold first  
- **Specific Identification:** choose which coins you sold (needs good record-keeping)  

Most automated crypto tax software handles this for you — which saves **a ton of headache** when filing.

## 🔹 Section 4: Reporting for Businesses vs Individuals

### 🔹 Individual Investors

- Focus on **capital gains and income reporting**  
- Track **each disposal**, including small transactions  
- Use software to **generate a single annual report** for your accountant or filing  

### 🔹 Businesses and Crypto Services

- Must track **income, expenses, and payroll in crypto**  
- Maintain **AML/KYC compliance alongside taxes**  
- Prepare for **audits** using detailed reports  
- Tools like [crypto-compliance-tools](https://txchyon.com/blog/regulatory-tax/crypto-compliance-tools) are essential

## 🔹 Section 5: Record Keeping Tips

Even with software, you need good habits:  

- Keep **all exchange statements and wallet histories**  
- Log **staking rewards, airdrops, and mining income**  
- Backup your reports — you never know when an auditor will knock  

> Fun fact: the IRS and HMRC can request records **years later**. Don’t make it worse on yourself.

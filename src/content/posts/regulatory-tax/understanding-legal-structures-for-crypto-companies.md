## 🏢 Section 1: Traditional Structures

### 🔹 Sole Proprietorship

- Quick and easy to start  
- Minimal reporting requirements  
- Personal liability for business debts  
- Best for small-scale trading or testing projects  

### 🔹 LLC (Limited Liability Company)

- Protects personal assets  
- Flexible tax treatment  
- Easier than a corporation to manage  
- Popular with small to medium crypto businesses  

### 🔹 Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp)

- Strong liability protection  
- Ability to raise investor capital  
- More administrative requirements  
- Suitable for exchanges, platforms, or larger teams  

**Pro Tip:** LLCs are generally best for most crypto entrepreneurs unless you plan to raise venture capital.

## 🌐 Section 2: DAOs and Emerging Structures

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are changing the game.  

- DAOs can operate without a traditional board of directors  
- Legal recognition is emerging in some jurisdictions (e.g., Wyoming DAO LLCs)  
- Useful for collective projects, open-source platforms, or community-owned crypto projects

Operating globally? Consider:  

- **Incorporating in crypto-friendly jurisdictions:** e.g., Switzerland, Singapore, Estonia  
- **Cross-border tax obligations:** Some countries have specific crypto tax rules  
- **Banking integration:** Certain jurisdictions make banking easier for crypto entities  

> Tip: International legal structures can reduce friction for cross-border operations, but always get local legal advice.

## 📌 Introduction — Why Your Crypto Business Needs a Legal Entity

Running a crypto business without a legal entity is like driving a car without insurance — it might feel fine until something goes wrong. Forming a company protects you legally and gives you tax advantages.  

Whether you’re trading professionally, launching a DeFi project, or managing NFTs, having a structured entity helps:  

- Separate personal and business liabilities  
- Qualify for tax deductions  
- Open business bank accounts  
- Stay compliant with regulations globally

## 🏢 Section 1: Choosing the Right Entity Type

There are several ways to structure your crypto business. Each comes with pros and cons.  

### 🔹 Sole Proprietorship

- Easiest to set up; taxed as personal income  
- Minimal legal separation — your personal assets are exposed  
- Best for hobby-level trading or testing a small project  

### 🔹 LLC (Limited Liability Company)

- Separates personal and business liability  
- Flexible tax treatment: can be taxed as sole proprietor, partnership, or corporation  
- Easier to manage than a corporation; fewer administrative requirements  
- Great for crypto trading businesses, NFT projects, or small exchanges  

### 🔹 Corporation (C-Corp or S-Corp in the U.S.)

- Strong liability protection  
- Ability to raise investment capital  
- Complex setup and ongoing administrative work  
- Best for startups, exchanges, or crypto service providers  

**Pro Tip:** Consult a crypto-savvy accountant or lawyer to pick the best structure for your business and jurisdiction.

## 🌐 Section 2: International Considerations

Crypto businesses often operate cross-border. Here’s what to consider:  

- **Tax Residency:** Where your company is registered affects taxation  
- **Licensing Requirements:** Some countries require crypto-specific licenses  
- **Banking Access:** Some jurisdictions are more crypto-friendly  
- **Legal Recognition of DAOs:** Some countries are starting to recognize DAOs as legal entities

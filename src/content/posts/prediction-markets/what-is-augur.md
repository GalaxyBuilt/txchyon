# What Is Augur? The Complete Beginner’s Guide to the OG Decentralized Prediction Market (2025)

Prediction markets have come a long way since the early days of crypto dreaming big about crowdsourced truth. Enter Augur, the granddaddy of them all, launched back in 2018 after years of hype as the fully decentralized betting protocol on Ethereum. Founded in 2014 by the Forecast Foundation, it was meant to be the uncensorable, trustless oracle where anyone could create markets on literally anything without a middleman stealing fees or shutting things down.

Fast forward to 2025, and Augur is in reboot mode with Augur Turbo on Polygon for faster trades and a planned next-gen oracle upgrade. It has seen its share of ups and downs, including infamous assassination markets early on and stubbornly low volume compared to newcomers. Yet it remains the purest vision of decentralized prediction power, powered by REP tokens for reporting outcomes.

If you are coming from our guides on [What Is Polymarket?](https://txchyon.com/blog/prediction-markets/what-is-polymarket/) or Worm.wtf, Augur feels like the wise but slightly eccentric elder statesman, prioritizing absolute decentralization over flashy growth.

# How Augur Works (Simple Explanation)

Augur is a peer-to-peer protocol for binary (and sometimes scalar) prediction markets. Users create events as questions like "Will Ethereum hit $10,000 in 2025?" Shares trade based on crowd probability, settling at $1 for correct outcomes or zero for wrong.

The magic, or headache depending on who you ask, is in resolution. Anyone can report outcomes, but REP holders stake their tokens to confirm truth. Disputes escalate, potentially forking REP into versions where wrong ones become worthless, forcing honesty through economics.

Augur v2 migrated to REPv2 in 2020, and recent efforts include Augur Turbo for cheaper, faster markets on Polygon using Chainlink oracles. No central approval needed, truly permissionless creation.

# Why Augur Still Matters in 2025 (Even With Low Volume)

Augur pioneered the space but struggled with Ethereum gas fees, complex UX, and slow adoption. Trading volume hovers low, with REP token daily volume around $70,000 lately. Critics call it a relic next to billion-dollar giants.

Yet the reboot signals life. New teams are building faster layers, better oracles, and even sports-focused products. It embodies crypto ideals: no KYC, global access, censorship resistance. In a world where regulated platforms face state bans, Augur just keeps running on-chain.

For purists chasing uncensorable markets on controversial topics, nothing beats it.

# Augur vs Polymarket, Worm.wtf, and Kalshi: Key Advantages

Head-to-head time, because every prediction market fan loves a good comparison.

Against **Polymarket**: Polymarket rules volume with slick UX and massive liquidity on big events. But it is centralized in practice, with approval for markets and US restrictions lifted only recently. Augur wins pure decentralization, no single point of failure, permissionless everything. If Polymarket is the efficient corporation, Augur is the anarchist collective that cannot be shut down.

Against **Worm.wtf**: The Solana speed demon with AI creation and creator rewards shines for viral, fast markets. Augur counters with battle-tested security and no reliance on trendy chains. Worm feels fun and chaotic; Augur feels principled and enduring.

Against **Kalshi**: The regulated fiat powerhouse offers legal clarity, sports parlays, and mainstream partnerships like CNN. But it is gated by CFTC rules, no wild topics, higher barriers. Augur is raw crypto freedom, riskier with potential disputes but zero oversight.

In summary, Augur prioritizes ideological purity and resilience over scale and ease, perfect for those who value decentralization above all.

# Who Should Use Augur?

Crypto OGs, decentralization maximalists, or anyone wanting markets on taboo subjects without fear of takedowns. It suits patient traders okay with thinner liquidity and hands-on reporting.

Not ideal for beginners chasing high-volume events or fiat ease, better stick to Kalshi or Polymarket there.

# How to Get Started on Augur (Step-by-Step)

1. Get an Ethereum or Polygon wallet like MetaMask.

2. Acquire ETH or MATIC for gas, plus stablecoins for trading.

3. Visit augur.net or Turbo interfaces.

4. Connect wallet and browse/create markets.

5. Trade shares, stake REP if you want to report.

Interfaces have improved, but expect some crypto jank compared to centralized apps.

# Is Augur Safe and Legit?

Fully on-chain with audited contracts, but oracle disputes and low liquidity carry risks. No hacks in core protocol, strong economic security model. As a protocol, it sidesteps much regulation, shifting responsibility to users. DYOR heavily on market rules.

# Final Thoughts — Is Augur Worth Trying in 2025?

Augur may never reclaim the spotlight, but its reboot and unwavering decentralization make it a cornerstone of the space. In an era of regulated giants and fast chains, it reminds us why prediction markets started on blockchain, uncensorable truth-seeking.

If you believe in crypto principles over convenience, dive in. It is the original, still kicking.

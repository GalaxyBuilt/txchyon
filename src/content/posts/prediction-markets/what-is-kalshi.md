# What Is Kalshi? The Complete Beginner’s Guide to the Regulated Prediction Market Giant

While crypto degens battled regulators on offshore platforms, Kalshi took the boring but brilliant route: full CFTC regulation. Launched in 2021, this New York-based exchange became the first federally overseen prediction market, trading event contracts on everything from elections to sports parlays, weather, and IPOs.

By late 2025, Kalshi hit $11 billion valuation after a $1 billion raise, processing billions in monthly volume, often outpacing Polymarket. Partnerships with CNN, CNBC, and even Phantom wallet for crypto access cemented its mainstream push. Over 90% of activity is now sports, but it started with macro events.

If our [What Is Polymarket?](https://txchyon.com/blog/prediction-markets/what-is-polymarket) guide showed the wild crypto side, Kalshi is the polished, legal Wall Street version, fiat-friendly and state-proof thanks to federal oversight.

# How Kalshi Works (Simple Explanation)

Kalshi offers binary event contracts: Yes/No on real-world outcomes, priced from $0.01 to $0.99 reflecting probability. Buy Yes if you think it happens, No otherwise. Correct? $1 payout. Wrong? Zero.

Markets cover politics (post-court wins), sports (including parlays and transfer portals), finance, climate, culture. Resolution uses official sources, automated where possible.

Self-certification lets quick listings, like college player transfers. Fiat deposits, no crypto needed originally, though now bridging in.

# Why Kalshi Exploded in 2025

Regulation was the moat. Court victories over CFTC on elections, state pushback dismissed, opened floodgates. Massive funding fueled marketing, broker integrations, media deals.

Volume surged to $5-6 billion monthly peaks, app downloads soared. Sports dominance and parlays attracted gamblers seeking legal alternatives.

It turned prediction markets into a trillion-dollar vision, financializing opinions safely.

# Kalshi vs Polymarket, Worm.wtf, and Augur: Key Advantages

The regulated vs decentralized showdown.

Against **Polymarket**: Both hit billions in volume, but Kalshi wins US legality, fiat ease, no VPN nonsense. Polymarket edges global crypto access, niche markets. Kalshi feels like a stock app; Polymarket like a degen playground.

Against **Worm.wtf**: Solana's creator-focused chaos contrasts Kalshi's institutional polish. Worm cheaper and faster for crypto natives, but Kalshi offers regulatory safety, broader events including sports parlays.

Against **Augur**: The decentralized pioneer lacks Kalshi's liquidity, UX, volume. Kalshi provides trust via CFTC, easier onboarding. Augur uncensorable; Kalshi compliant and massive scale.

Overall, Kalshi dominates for US users wanting legal, high-volume trading without crypto hassle.

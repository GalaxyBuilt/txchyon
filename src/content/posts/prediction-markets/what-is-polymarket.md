# What Is Polymarket? The Complete Beginner’s Guide (2025)
*Learn how prediction markets work, how to place your first trade, and how to start profiting from real-world events.*

---

## What Is Polymarket?
Polymarket is the world’s largest **prediction market platform**, where users trade on real-world events using YES/NO shares. Instead of betting against a sportsbook or casino, you trade against other participants based on **probabilities**.

You can trade on events such as:

- Political elections  
- Crypto and Bitcoin price outcomes  
- Economic indicators (CPI, inflation, rate cuts)  
- Sports results  
- Pop culture  
- Viral meme events

Each market has two possible outcomes:

- **YES** – event happens  
- **NO** – event does not happen  

Shares trade between $0.01 and $1.00, reflecting market-implied probabilities.

---

## How Polymarket Works (Simple Explanation)
Every market revolves around a **probability price**:

- If YES is $0.45 → the market believes there's a **45% chance** the event will occur.  
- If the event happens → YES settles at **$1.00**.  
- If it doesn’t → YES settles at **$0.00**.

You are essentially buying and selling **probabilities**.

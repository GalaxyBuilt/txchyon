# How to Earn Passive Yield as a Liquidity Provider on Prediction Markets

Most traders chase active edges, but the quiet money sits in liquidity provision. Prediction markets need balanced pools to function smoothly, and platforms pay you for supplying it. Think of it as running a market maker bot without writing code.

Rewards vary wildly by platform and market heat, but top providers pull steady four to six-figure annual yields on large positions. The trade-off is impermanent loss and resolution risk.

# Where Liquidity Providing Exists Today

Polymarket uses a hybrid order book with automated market makers on hot markets. Worm.wtf leans on bonding curves and pre-sales. Emerging protocols experiment with concentrated liquidity like Uniswap v3. Classic platforms like Augur rely on pure peer-to-peer.

Worm.wtf currently offers the juiciest creator-driven incentives, while Polymarket pays through trading fee shares on select pools.

# How It Works (Simple Version)

You deposit balanced Yes and No shares (or stablecoins that convert). Traders pay fees to swap between sides, and you collect a cut. At resolution, your shares settle like any position, but balanced provision minimizes directional risk.

Worm.wtf bonding curves let early providers exit loss-free if no trades occur. Polymarket rewards scale with volume your pool facilitates.

# Step-by-Step: Providing Liquidity on Worm.wtf

1. Connect Solana wallet to worm.wtf.
2. Find a market with pre-sale or active bonding curve.
3. Deposit USDC; the curve auto-balances your position.
4. Earn creator-style fees proportional to your share.
5. Withdraw anytime, potentially profit from curve shifts.

Fast, low-fee, perfect for viral markets.

# Step-by-Step: Polymarket Liquidity Programs

Polymarket runs invite-only or announced reward pools for major events. Monitor their Discord and X for drops. Once accepted, deposit into designated AMMs and earn fee shares plus occasional bonus tokens.

Higher barriers, bigger volume, institutional feel.

# Risks You Cannot Ignore

Impermanent loss hits when one side becomes heavily favored. Resolution risk: if the oracle goes wonky, balanced positions still lose. Low-volume markets pay peanuts and tie up capital forever.

Mitigate by sticking to high-conviction or heavily traded events, diversifying across platforms, and harvesting fees regularly.

# Current Best Opportunities

Worm.wtf pre-sales on trending topics often yield quick flips. Polymarket election aftermath pools still pay solid post-resolution fees. Watch for new concentrated liquidity experiments on Solana protocols.

# Who Should Provide Liquidity?

Patient capital with six-figure stacks gets the best risk-adjusted returns. Smaller players can start on Worm.wtf for practice. Active traders use it to park dry powder while waiting for edges.

It beats most DeFi yields right now without rug-pull drama.

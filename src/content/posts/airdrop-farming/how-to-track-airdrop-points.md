## Introduction

Tracking airdrop points across multiple wallets is **essential for any serious farmer**. Without organized monitoring, it’s easy to overfarm, miss high-value actions, or inadvertently trigger Sybil detection.

## Why Multi-Wallet Tracking Matters

- **Avoid Redundancy:** Prevent performing duplicate actions across wallets  
- **Maximize Points:** Focus on wallets yielding the highest ROI  
- **Prevent Sybil Detection:** Maintain unique behavior and timing per wallet  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Identify patterns and adjust strategy based on results

## Choosing a Tracking Method

### 1. Spreadsheets (Manual)
- List each wallet with on-chain and off-chain actions  
- Track points, timing, and cumulative totals  
- Pros: Flexible, easy to customize  
- Cons: Manual input can be error-prone for large numbers of wallets

### 2. Dashboards & Project Tools
- Many projects provide dashboards to see points per wallet  
- Pros: Directly integrates with project data, reliable  
- Cons: Limited to each project; not centralized

### 3. Custom Scripts or Trackers
- Pull on-chain data via APIs (etherscan, blockchain explorers)  
- Aggregate across wallets for consistent analysis  
- Pros: Automates tracking, scalable  
- Cons: Requires technical knowledge and maintenance

## What to Track

| Metric | Why It Matters | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| On-chain actions | Determines base points | Transactions, staking, LP contributions |
| Off-chain actions | Adds extra weight | Discord, GitHub, testnets, social activity |
| Wallet timing | Avoid burst patterns | Helps prevent Sybil flags |
| Cumulative points | Evaluate ROI per wallet | Identify underperforming wallets |
| Snapshot alignment | Ensure actions count | Check when projects take snapshots |

## Best Practices

1. **Label & Organize Wallets**  
   - Assign wallets to campaigns, projects, or scoring types  
   - Maintain clear naming conventions

2. **Stagger Actions Across Wallets**  
   - Avoid performing identical sequences  
   - Introduce timing variation for human-like activity

3. **Track Regularly**  
   - Update daily or weekly depending on activity  
   - Highlight wallets at risk of low points or Sybil suspicion

4. **Analyze & Adjust**  
   - Reallocate effort to high-performing wallets  
   - Stop low-yield or risky activity

5. **Backup & Secure Data**  
   - Keep spreadsheets or dashboards in secure storage  
   - Avoid exposing private keys or sensitive wallet info

## Tools to Enhance Tracking

- **On-Chain Explorers:** Verify all blockchain interactions  
- **Multi-Project Dashboards:** Consolidate data from multiple airdrops  
- **API Integrations:** Automate data collection for large wallets  
- **Visualization Tools:** Graph points over time and detect anomalies

## Key Takeaways

- Organized tracking is the backbone of **efficient and safe airdrop farming**  
- Maintain **wallet hygiene, human-like behavior, and clear labeling**  
- Combine with cluster insights for **points optimization, timing, and Sybil avoidance**  
- Data-driven decisions ensure maximum rewards while minimizing risk

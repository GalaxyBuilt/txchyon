## Why "Doing the Right Actions" Still Gets You Zero Airdrops

One of the most common frustrations in airdrop farming is this:

> *"I used the protocol, I earned points, I followed the guide… and still got nothing."*

That's because **airdrop eligibility is not a checklist**.

Projects don't simply ask *what* you did — they evaluate **how**, **why**, **how often**, and **how your behavior compares to real users**. Eligibility is the invisible filter that sits *above* points systems, activity tracking, and wallet history.

This guide breaks down **how eligibility is really determined**, what signals matter most, and how to structure your farming so your wallet looks valuable — not extractive.

## Eligibility vs Points: The Difference Most Farmers Miss

Points systems are **scoring mechanisms**.  
Eligibility is **qualification logic**.

You can earn points and still be excluded if:
- Your activity looks automated  
- Your wallet behavior mirrors Sybil patterns  
- You fail minimum usage or duration thresholds  
- Your interactions lack economic or social intent

Think of eligibility as a **gate**, and points as **weight inside the gate**.

If your wallet never passes the gate, points don't matter.

## The Core Data Projects Use to Determine Eligibility

Most modern airdrops evaluate wallets across **five major dimensions**:

### 1. Wallet Age & Behavioral History

Projects favor wallets that:
- Existed *before* the airdrop announcement  
- Show organic activity over time  
- Interacted with multiple unrelated protocols

Fresh wallets created solely to farm are not automatically disqualified — but they are **heavily scrutinized**.

---

### 2. Meaningful Protocol Usage (Not Just Transactions)

Eligibility algorithms don't just count interactions — they analyze **intent**.

High-quality signals include:
- Repeated usage over time  
- Using multiple features (not just one action)  
- Holding positions, not instant in-and-out behavior  
- Taking normal user risk (impermanent loss, market exposure, fees)

Low-quality signals include:
- One-time "touch and go" interactions  
- Identical transaction sizing across wallets  
- Perfectly timed, repetitive behavior

Projects want **users**, not scripts.

---

### 3. Time-Based Engagement Thresholds

Many airdrops quietly enforce:
- Minimum active days  
- Sustained usage windows  
- Epoch-based participation requirements

This is why last-minute farming often fails.

---

### 4. Capital Commitment Relative to Chain Norms

Eligibility systems normalize behavior **relative to the ecosystem**.

Example:
- $50 of activity on Solana may be meaningful  
- $50 on Ethereum mainnet may signal low conviction

What matters is **contextual commitment**, not absolute dollars.

### 5. Sybil Risk Scoring (The Silent Killer)

Even if a project never says "Sybil," assume they are running:
- Wallet clustering analysis  
- Transaction similarity detection  
- Timing correlation models  
- Funding source tracing

Things that raise flags:
- Multiple wallets funded from the same source  
- Identical action sequences  
- Same dApps, same order, same timing  
- Repeated exact transaction sizes

Avoiding Sybil flags is often more important than maximizing points.

## Eligibility Optimization Principles (The Right Way)

Instead of chasing every task, focus on these principles:

- Act like a real user, not a checklist follower  
- Spread activity over time  
- Use features naturally, not mechanically  
- Accept some friction (fees, losses, lockups)  
- Avoid perfectly repeatable patterns

Eligibility is about **believability**. If a human reviewer looked at your wallet, would it make sense?

## How Eligibility Fits Into the Airdrop Farming Framework

Eligibility optimization sits at the center of the entire strategy:

- **Wallet Strategy** → ensures baseline trust ([Cold vs Hot Wallets](/blog/airdrop-farming/cold-vs-hot-wallets-optimizing-security-and-eligibility/))  
- **Points Systems** → determine scoring after eligibility ([How Crypto Airdrop Points Systems Really Work](/blog/airdrop-farming/airdrop-points-case-studies/))  
- **Gas Optimization** → ensures cost efficiency without signaling low intent  
- **Multi-Chain Farming** → expands reach without duplicating patterns  
- **Tools & Tracking** → monitor activity safely ([How to Track Airdrop Points Across Multiple Wallets](/blog/airdrop-farming/how-to-track-airdrop-points/))

Ignoring eligibility leaks alpha from every other cluster.

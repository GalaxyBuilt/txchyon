## Why Minimum Activity Thresholds Matter

Earning points is only half the battle. Projects often enforce **minimum activity thresholds** to ensure airdrops go to wallets that contribute meaningfully to their ecosystem.

Without meeting these thresholds, your wallet may:
- Earn points but never qualify  
- Trigger automated filters as "low-value"  
- Be deprioritized for retroactive or bonus airdrops  

Think of thresholds as **the invisible eligibility bar** — high enough to weed out bots and low-effort wallets, but not so high that reasonable users are excluded.

## Common Threshold Metrics Across Chains

While each project is different, these are the **most common minimum activity signals**:

### 1. Number of Transactions
- Minimum number of interactions with a protocol over a defined period
- Includes trades, staking, governance votes, and liquidity provision
- Simple high-frequency interactions without variation are often discounted

### 2. Active Days / Engagement Windows
- Projects track **active days**, not just total transactions  
- Wallets that interact sporadically may fail even if total transactions look high  
- Example: 20 transactions spread across 20 days > 20 transactions in 1 day

### 3. Feature Diversity
- Using multiple features signals *real participation*  
- Example: staking + trading + governance voting  
- Single-feature activity often triggers low eligibility weighting

### 4. Volume / Capital Commitment
- Some airdrops factor relative dollar value or token holdings  
- Low-volume wallets can qualify if consistent; high-volume wallets with erratic behavior may not  
- Goal: show meaningful participation relative to the ecosystem

### 5. Historical Participation
- Prior usage of related products or similar projects increases eligibility  
- Projects reward early or long-term users even with lower activity in the latest campaign

## How to Optimize Without Overfarming

Minimum thresholds are a guide — not a ceiling. To optimize safely:

- **Distribute activity naturally**: spread interactions over days and weeks  
- **Vary transaction sizes**: avoid repeated identical actions  
- **Use multiple features**: mix staking, trades, governance, and liquidity  
- **Track progress**: use dashboards or spreadsheets to ensure thresholds are met without overdoing it  
- **Avoid last-minute spikes**: sudden heavy activity can look bot-like

This ensures you hit the bar **without triggering red flags**.

## Examples From Real Airdrops

| Project | Threshold Type | Strategy Tip |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Solana Snowball | Active Days | Spread token interactions over 4–6 weeks |
| Pump.fun | Transaction Count | Mix swaps, mints, and staking; avoid identical sizes |
| Polymarket | Feature Diversity | Participate in both trading and prediction markets |

Notice the common thread: **quality beats quantity**, and consistency beats "one big push."

## Integrating Activity Thresholds With Eligibility

Minimum thresholds link directly to your overall eligibility strategy:

- **Wallet Strategy** → ensures you have enough diversified wallets to distribute activity ([Avoiding Red Flags: Wallet Hygiene and Compliance in Airdrop Farming](/blog/airdrop-farming/avoiding-red-flags-wallet-hygiene-and-compliance/))  
- **Points Systems** → make sure each wallet earns points efficiently while hitting thresholds ([Optimizing Airdrop Points Without Overfarming or Getting Flagged](/blog/airdrop-farming/optimizing-airdrop-points-safely/))  
- **Gas Optimization** → manage cost while meeting minimum interactions  
- **Tools & Tracking** → track activity across wallets ([How to Track Airdrop Points Across Multiple Wallets](/blog/airdrop-farming/how-to-track-airdrop-points/))

The more structured your approach, the easier it is to scale across chains and projects.

## Key Takeaways

1. Minimum thresholds are often invisible but critical  
2. Consistency, diversity, and context matter more than sheer volume  
3. Overfarming or uniform actions can hurt eligibility  
4. Track, measure, and optimize — don't guess

Meeting these thresholds transforms **points-earned wallets** into **fully eligible wallets**, unlocking the alpha in your airdrop farming strategy.

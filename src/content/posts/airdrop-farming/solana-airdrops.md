# The Solana Airdrop Snowball: Your Guide to 4 High-Value Token Rewards

Airdrops are a way for new protocols to bootstrap their community and reward early adopters. On Solana, airdrops are now one of the highest-value opportunities for retail crypto users.

This guide provides a consolidated, step-by-step strategy for the four most sought-after, confirmed, or strongly rumored airdrop campaigns on Solana.

## Phase 0: The Essential Burner Wallet Strategy (IMPORTANT SECURITY WARNING)

The single most important rule in airdrop farming is to **NEVER use your main crypto wallet (your "Vault")**. You must use a dedicated, separate wallet for this high-risk activity.

### The Burner Wallet Rule:
A **Burner Wallet** is a secondary hot wallet (like a second Phantom account) that is used exclusively for interacting with new, un-audited, or experimental protocols. This prevents a malicious smart contract—often disguised as an airdrop claim or DeFi protocol—from draining your long-term holdings.

> **⚠️ WARNING: ISOLATE YOUR FUNDS**
> If you connect a malicious contract to your Burner Wallet, only the funds inside that Burner Wallet are at risk. If you connect your main wallet, you risk losing *everything*. **Always transfer any airdrop wins or profits out of the Burner Wallet and into your secure Main Wallet (preferably cold storage) immediately.**

### Getting Started:

* **Need a Wallet?** The recommended wallet for Solana is Phantom. If you don't have it set up yet:

* **Need Crypto?** To fund your Burner Wallet, you'll need SOL. If you don't know where to start:

## 1. Tensor ($TNSR): The NFT Marketplace Rewards

Tensor is the leading NFT marketplace on Solana. They have confirmed their $TNSR token and run rewards programs (Seasons) where users earn **Points** for trading activity.

| Project Type | Status | Core Activity to Farm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NFT Marketplace** | **Token Confirmed** ($TNSR) & Seasons Ongoing | **Bidding, Listing, and Market-Making** on popular collections. |

### Step-by-Step Farming Guide:

1.  **Connect Burner Wallet:** Go to **Tensor** and connect your dedicated **Burner Wallet**.
2.  **Listing:** List an NFT you own for sale on Tensor. You earn points simply for having an active listing. *Tip: Use the **Bonding Curve** feature to automatically adjust the price.*
3.  **Bidding:** Place a **Bid** on a popular collection (e.g., any trending Solana PFP project). The closer your bid is to the **Floor Price**, the more points you earn.
4.  **Market Making:** For maximum points, use the **Market Making** tool to simultaneously place bids and listings on a collection.
5.  **Activity is Key:** Perform these actions regularly across the current **Season** to earn the most 'Treasure Boxes' which contain the $TNSR allocation.

## 2. Parcl ($PARCL): Decentralized Real Estate Trading

Parcl is a Real World Asset (RWA) protocol where you can trade the price movements of major city real estate indices. They use a point system to reward users contributing to liquidity and trading volume.

| Project Type | Status | Core Activity to Farm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DeFi / RWA** | **Token Confirmed** ($PARCL) & Point System Active | **Provide Liquidity** and **Trade** on the perpetual market. |

### Step-by-Step Farming Guide:

1.  **Connect Burner Wallet:** Go to **Parcl** and connect your **Burner Wallet**.
2.  **Provide Liquidity:** Deposit USDC into the **Parcl Liquidity Pool** (the 'Parcl Data Fund'). This is the highest-weighted activity for earning points.
3.  **Trade Perpetual:** Go to the **Trade** tab and take a long or short position on a real estate market (e.g., 'Miami,' 'New York'). Use a small amount of leverage.
4.  **Hold & Compound:** The longer you keep your liquidity staked, the more points you earn. You can compound your points for better future allocation.
5.  **Referrals:** The project strongly rewards users who invite others.

## 3. Zeta Markets ($Z): Decentralized Derivatives Exchange

Zeta Markets is a decentralized exchange (DEX) offering derivatives trading (futures/options) on Solana. They reward users based on their trading volume with an XP (Experience Points) system, which will determine the $Z token airdrop size.

| Project Type | Status | Core Activity to Farm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DeFi / Derivatives** | **Token Confirmed** ($Z) & XP System Active | **High Trading Volume** (buying and selling futures). |

### Step-by-Step Farming Guide:

1.  **Connect Burner Wallet:** Go to **Zeta Markets** and connect your **Burner Wallet**.
2.  **Fund Wallet:** Deposit USDC into the Zeta Markets platform to use as collateral for trading.
3.  **Place Trades:** Go to the Futures market (e.g., SOL/USDC) and execute trades (both long and short). **Volume is the main metric.**
4.  **Focus on Fees:** Use Limit Orders when possible to act as a **Maker**, as this often accrues XP faster than taking market orders.
5.  **Consistent Activity:** Try to trade small amounts consistently rather than one large trade to demonstrate genuine, repeated use of the platform.

## 4. Pump.fun: Memecoin Launchpad

Pump.fun is the dominant platform for launching memecoins on Solana, generating massive fees and volume. The platform has confirmed an airdrop to reward early users, but the strategy requires careful risk management.

| Project Type | Status | Core Activity to Farm |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Memecoin Launchpad** | **Airdrop Confirmed** (Implied) | **Token Creation, Trading Volume**, and **Graduation** participation. |

### Full Farming Strategy and Details

Due to the unique nature and high-risk mechanics of Pump.fun, the strategy for maximizing your allocation is extensive.

For the comprehensive, step-by-step strategy, including **speculative reward tiers** and the **Dune Airdrop Checker tool**, please see our dedicated article:

## ⚠️ Airdrop Farming Safety Checklist

* **Revoke Approvals:** Regularly check which dApps have permission to spend your tokens and **Revoke** unlimited spending approvals.
* **Verify URLs:** Always double-check that you are on the **official URL** before connecting your wallet.
* **Move Wins:** Transfer all valuable assets (tokens, NFTs, and airdrops) out of the **Burner Wallet** as soon as possible.

## Introduction

One of the biggest misconceptions in airdrop farming is that **every action counts equally** toward points.  
Many users waste gas, time, and capital on meaningless transactions while missing the actions that actually matter.  

In this guide, we’ll break down **which actions earn points**, which do not, and why behavior matters more than volume. This article builds on concepts from [How Crypto Airdrop Points Systems Really Work](/airdrop-farming/airdrop-points-case-studies) and [Avoiding Red Flags: Wallet Hygiene and Compliance in Airdrop Farming](/airdrop-farming/avoiding-red-flags-wallet-hygiene-and-compliance).

## Understanding “Point-Worthy” Actions

Projects track multiple types of activity to determine **eligibility and allocation**. Actions generally fall into two categories:

1. **On-Chain Actions** – Direct interactions with blockchain protocols  
2. **Off-Chain Actions** – Community engagement, governance, or testing

Each carries different **weighting and verification methods**, and many actions are only meaningful when combined with proper wallet hygiene.

---

### On-Chain Actions That Earn Points

These are actions recorded **directly on-chain**. They are objective and verifiable.

#### 1. Token Transfers
- Only meaningful when interacting with protocol contracts  
- Repeated wallet-to-wallet transfers **often ignored**  
- Strategic transfers (e.g., staking or sending to liquidity pools) are valued

#### 2. Staking
- Long-term staking shows commitment  
- Short bursts may earn points in some systems but are lower weighted  
- Longer staking → higher point multiplier

#### 3. Liquidity Provision
- Providing liquidity to pools is highly weighted in most DeFi airdrops  
- Quality is evaluated: size, duration, and risk taken

#### 4. Governance Participation
- Voting, proposals, and forum discussions may all count  
- Repeated spam votes do not  
- Projects monitor uniqueness of voter behavior

#### 5. Contract Interaction
- Meaningful contract calls (minting, swapping, bridging)  
- Low-value or repeated calls are often filtered

---

### Off-Chain Actions That Earn Points

Some points come from activity **outside the blockchain**, often via project dashboards or community platforms.

#### 1. Community Engagement
- Discord participation, Telegram messages  
- Weighted for unique, constructive activity, not spam  
- Verified accounts often get higher weight

#### 2. Testnet Feedback
- Bug reports, feature tests, and testnet staking  
- Shows real contribution

#### 3. Social Media Participation
- Sharing content, commenting, or participating in challenges  
- Usually tracked via project dashboards or manual verification

#### 4. Developer Contributions
- GitHub commits, pull requests, open-source contributions  
- Rare but highly weighted in technical projects

## Actions That Often Do NOT Earn Points

### Repetitive, Low-Value Transactions
- Moving tokens between your own wallets repeatedly  
- “Dusting” or micro-transfers to appear active

### Bulk or Automated Farming
- Scripts that claim rewards automatically  
- These often trigger anti-Sybil filters

### Excess Gas Spending
- Spending more gas doesn’t equal more points  
- Smart usage is rewarded, spam is ignored

### Duplicate Accounts or Wallet Clones
- Projects monitor patterns across multiple wallets  
- High risk for disqualification or blacklisting

> Tip: Avoid actions that appear **mechanical or automated** — points systems are designed to reward human-like behavior.

---

## Timing and Frequency Matter

Points are not just about *what* you do but also *when* you do it.

- **Burst Farming**: Performing all actions in a short window is suspicious  
- **Steady Engagement**: Points accumulate more reliably over time  
- **Snapshots**: Some projects evaluate points at specific times; actions outside the snapshot may not count  

Proper timing strategies link back to [Time-Based vs Volume-Based Airdrop Points Systems](/airdrop-farming/time-vs-volume-points-systems).

---

## Multi-Wallet Considerations

If you operate multiple wallets, remember:

- Spread meaningful actions across wallets **gradually**  
- Avoid identical sequences across wallets  
- Maintain wallet hygiene as described in [Avoiding Red Flags: Wallet Hygiene and Compliance in Airdrop Farming](/airdrop-farming/avoiding-red-flags-wallet-hygiene-and-compliance)  

Quality always outweighs quantity in points accumulation.

## Real-World Examples

| Action | Points Likely Earned | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Staking 100 tokens for 30 days | High | Shows commitment and risk |
| Sending tokens between your own wallets | Low/0 | Often ignored by scoring engines |
| Participating in governance vote | Medium | Repeated spam votes ignored |
| Posting meaningful bug report | High | Off-chain but verified and weighted |
| Automated faucet claims | Low/0 | Can trigger anti-Sybil detection |

---

## Tools to Track “Point-Worthy” Actions

- **On-Chain Explorers:** Track meaningful transactions, staking, and LP participation  
- **Project Dashboards:** Monitor off-chain actions, tests, and community contributions  
- **Custom Spreadsheets:** Combine on-chain + off-chain metrics for easier management  

These tools help maintain clarity and avoid wasted effort.

---

## Conclusion

Farming points effectively is about **signal quality, timing, and wallet hygiene**, not simply volume.  

Focus on:  

- meaningful on-chain interactions  
- verified off-chain contributions  
- consistency and timing  
- clean multi-wallet management

Following these strategies ensures you **maximize point accumulation without risking disqualification**.

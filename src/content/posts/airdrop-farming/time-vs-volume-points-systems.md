## Introduction

Understanding **how points are scored over time versus volume** is crucial for effective airdrop farming. Many farmers focus solely on volume — making many transactions or staking large sums — without realizing that **timing and consistency often carry more weight**.  

This article builds on [What Actions Actually Earn Airdrop Points (And What Doesn’t)](/airdrop-farming/what-actions-earn-airdrop-points) and [How Crypto Airdrop Points Systems Really Work](/airdrop-farming/airdrop-points-case-studies).

## Time-Based Scoring Systems

Time-based systems evaluate **how consistently and steadily** a wallet interacts with the protocol.  

### Key Characteristics:

- **Continuous tracking:** Points accumulate gradually over time  
- **Consistency matters:** Steady engagement is rewarded more than bursts  
- **Long-term alignment:** Projects favor wallets that demonstrate ongoing commitment  

### Examples of Time-Based Actions:

- Daily or weekly staking  
- Regular liquidity provision  
- Frequent governance participation over months  

### Benefits:

- Discourages burst-farming and automated spamming  
- Encourages natural wallet growth  
- Reduces risk of being flagged as a Sybil cluster

## Volume-Based Scoring Systems

Volume-based systems prioritize **total activity or capital deployed**, often measured over a snapshot period.

### Key Characteristics:

- **High volume interactions** earn more points in a short window  
- **Snapshot evaluation:** Points are often calculated at the end of a campaign or prior to TGE  
- **Diminishing returns:** Many protocols cap points to prevent whales from dominating  

### Examples of Volume-Based Actions:

- Large staking amounts within a short period  
- Multiple contract interactions executed in a concentrated time  
- High transaction counts over a snapshot window  

### Risks:

- Burst activity can be flagged as automated  
- High clustering of wallets can trigger anti-Sybil detection  
- Over-concentration may reduce long-term rewards

## Combining Time and Volume

Most modern airdrops **blend both scoring methods**:  

- **Time-based weighting** ensures steady users are rewarded  
- **Volume-based weighting** ensures significant contributions are recognized  

Optimizing requires balancing **how much** you do and **when** you do it.  

### Practical Strategy:

1. Maintain consistent, moderate activity across all wallets  
2. Avoid performing all actions in a single day or block  
3. Prioritize meaningful transactions over repetitive micro-transactions  
4. Track your progress using dashboards or custom spreadsheets ([How to Track Airdrop Points Across Multiple Wallets](/airdrop-farming/how-to-track-airdrop-points))

## Timing Considerations

Timing strategies differ depending on the protocol:

| Strategy | When to Use | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Steady Engagement | Continuous scoring systems | Builds trust and reduces Sybil risk |
| Burst Activity | Snapshot or volume-based | Effective if executed carefully, but risky |
| Staggered Multi-Wallet Action | All systems | Prevents identical wallet patterns and clustering |
| Pre-Snapshot Preparation | Snapshot-based | Avoid last-minute spam; ensure quality |

## Real-World Examples

- **Protocol A (Time-Based)**: Rewards staking every week for 6 months  
- **Protocol B (Volume-Based)**: Awards points based on total tokens staked in a 48-hour window  
- **Protocol C (Hybrid)**: Uses continuous scoring but applies a snapshot multiplier for large volume interactions  

> Understanding the system type is critical before scaling wallet activity.

## Risks of Misalignment

- Focusing solely on volume in time-based systems may **dilute points**  
- Burst activity in time-based scoring may **trigger Sybil filters**  
- Overusing wallets across multiple campaigns without variation increases **blacklisting risk**  

Proper wallet hygiene and multi-wallet separation remain essential ([Mastering Wallet Diversification for Airdrop Farming](/airdrop-farming/mastering-wallet-diversification-for-airdrop-farming)).

## Key Takeaways

- Identify whether the protocol uses **time-based, volume-based, or hybrid** scoring  
- Adjust your activity for **consistency, meaningful actions, and timing**  
- Track each wallet’s points and avoid repetitive patterns  
- Combine insights with strategies from [What Actions Actually Earn Airdrop Points (And What Doesn’t)](/airdrop-farming/what-actions-earn-airdrop-points) for maximum efficiency

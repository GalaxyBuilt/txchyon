Choosing the right hardware is key to a smooth Bitcoin node experience. This article expands on the hardware section in [What Is a Bitcoin Node and Why You Need One](https://txchyon.com/blog/infrastructure-tech/what-is-a-bitcoin-node-and-why-you-need-one), providing in-depth reviews.

### Top Hardware Picks
1. **Raspberry Pi 5**: Best for beginners. Affordable ($60–100), low power (5–10W). Setup guide in [Bitcoin Node on Raspberry Pi](https://txchyon.com/blog/infrastructure-tech/how-to-set-up-bitcoin-node-on-raspberry-pi).
2. **Intel NUC Mini-PC**: Mid-range power. 16GB RAM, 2TB SSD (~$400). Handles full archival nodes easily.
3. **Custom Server Build**: For pros. Ryzen CPU, 32GB RAM, 4TB SSD (~$800+). Ideal for high-bandwidth operations.
4. **Pre-Built Nodes**: myNode or Start9 (~$300–500). Plug-and-play with extras like Lightning support—see [Setting Up a Lightning Network Node](https://txchyon.com/blog/infrastructure-tech/how-to-setup-up-lightning-network-node).

### Factors to Consider
- **Storage Needs**: 650GB+ for full nodes; prune for less.
- **Power Consumption**: Aim for under 50W for home use.
- **Privacy Enhancements**: Pair with VPNs from [Bitcoin Privacy Best Practices](/bitcoin-privacy-best-practices).

### Benchmarks (2026 Estimates)
- Sync Time: Pi (3–7 days), NUC (1–2 days), Server (<1 day).
- Monthly Bandwidth: 30–60GB.

# idOS Network 2025: The Only Chain-Agnostic Identity Layer Actually Shipping — And How to Farm Its Confirmed Airdrop Right Now

Web3 has been missing one critical primitive since 2017: **a universal, private, portable identity layer** that works everywhere.

idOS just solved it — and it’s already live on mainnet with 1.2M+ real users.

### The Problem idOS Crushes (2025 Reality)
- Airdrop farmers running 10,000 wallets  
- Projects wasting $5M–$50M per year on centralized KYC vendors  
- No on-chain reputation that travels between chains  
- Soulbound tokens that are actually just expensive NFTs nobody uses  

idOS is a **fully decentralized, chain-agnostic identity & storage network** — its own L1 with encrypted user-controlled data vaults and zero-knowledge credential issuance.

### Live Stats — November 25, 2025
- **1.28M active idOS profiles**  
- **487k verified credentials issued** (KYC, credit scores, on-chain activity proofs)  
- **41 live chain integrations** (EVM, Solana, NEAR, Starknet, Cosmos, Tezos, Aleph Zero, etc.)  
- **92% cheaper** than Galxe/QuestN/Civic for projects  
- **$42M TVL** in encrypted storage vaults  
- **Confirmed TGE Q1 2026** + massive retroactive airdrop already farming

### How idOS Actually Works (No Private Keys Ever Leave Your Device)
1. Connect wallet once → idOS creates an encrypted vault using your keyshare + device biometrics  
2. Verify anything (KYC, Gitcoin Passport, on-chain volume, socials) → stored as zk-credentials  
3. Selectively disclose proofs cross-chain without ever revealing underlying data  

Examples you can prove in one click:
- “I’m KYC’d” (without showing passport)  
- “I’m top 5% Solana trader” (without exposing addresses)  
- “I’ve held >$100k TVL for 18 months”  
- “I’m not a sybil” (Gitcoin Passport + idOS score)

### Major Live Integrations (November 2025)
- **Circle** — Portable USDC KYC across 15 chains  
- **Ripple** — On-chain reputation for cross-border payments  
- **Arbitrum Orbit chains** — Higher borrow limits using idOS credit scores  
- **Starknet** — Sybil-resistant governance voting  
- **NEAR & Gnosis** — Fair airdrops using idOS reputation  
- **Wallchain** — Official airdrop farming partner (leaderboard live)

### The Confirmed idOS Airdrop — Farm It Right Now
idOS has publicly confirmed a massive retroactive airdrop for early users and node runners.

**Best farming strategy right now (confirmed points):**
Wallchain leaderboard — the higher you rank, the bigger the allocation.

**Your personal referral link (replace with yours):**  
https://wallchain.xyz/?ref=txchyon

**Current top 100 cutoff:** ~14,200 points  
**Current #1 farmer:** 312,000+ points  
**Points earned so far by Txchyon node:** 41,800 (top 0.8%)

### Why This Matters in 2025
Every major protocol launching in 2025–2026 will require sybil resistance and portable reputation:
- LayerZero v2 airdrop  
- zkSync Era  
- Blast L2  
- Monad  
- New L3 app chains  

They’re all quietly integrating idOS because it’s the only solution that actually works across ecosystems.

### Final Call to Action
1. Create your idOS profile → https://app.idos.network  
2. Complete all verifications (KYC, wallet activity, socials)  
3. Start farming the Wallchain leaderboard → https://wallchain.xyz/?ref=txchyon  
4. (Optional) Run a node for 3–5× points multiplier

The identity meta is finally here.  
idOS is the only one shipping.

Get in before the airdrop snapshot.

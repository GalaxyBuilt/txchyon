# iopn Network: From Solana RPC Vision to EVM L1 Reality — What Changed?

#### Quick Summary
iopn Network started as a Solana-focused decentralized RPC and compute layer for AI agents, but as of mid-2025 it pivoted to launching its own EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain called **OPN Chain**. This shift was driven by the need for greater sovereignty, scalability, and real-world adoption in areas like digital identity and tokenized assets. The original Solana infra vision evolved into a full-stack ecosystem, but it's no longer "Solana-only" — it's now a Cosmos SDK-based chain with EVM compatibility.

#### The Original Vision (Early 2025)
- Decentralized RPC + compute layer purpose-built for autonomous AI agents on Solana  
- Sub-3ms finality for agent workloads  
- 68% cheaper than centralized RPCs (Helius, QuickNode)  
- zkLogin + TEE for on-chain proof of execution  
- 30% of all agent fees accruing directly to $IOPN stakers  

#### What Actually Happened — The Pivot Timeline
- **Q2 2025** → Initial Solana testnet, heavy focus on ElizaOS / SendAI integrations  
- **Q3 2025** → Partnership with São Tomé and Príncipe for the world's first blockchain-enabled citizenship program  
- **October 2025** → OPN Chain mainnet launch (Cosmos SDK + Tendermint BFT + full EVM compatibility)  
- **November 2025** → ATLAS platform (NVIDIA AI + GPU compute) fully live on OPN Chain  

#### Why They Pivoted to EVM L1
- **Sovereignty & RWAs** → Governments and enterprises need full control (digital ID, tokenized citizenship)  
- **EVM Maturity** → Solidity, ERC standards, and existing tooling make compliance easier than Solana VM  
- **Scalability** → Cosmos SDK gives modular upgrades + 10,000+ TPS with sub-second finality  
- **Cross-Chain Future** → Easier bridging to Ethereum ecosystem liquidity  

#### Updated Stats (November 25, 2025)
- 1.8M+ daily transactions (now across OPN Chain + Solana bridges)  
- 42,000+ active agents (many ported to EVM for Solidity support)  
- 10,000+ TPS on OPN Chain  
- $1.2M monthly revenue (staking + ATLAS GPU rentals + agent fees)  
- $26M TVL — 78% of circulating supply staked  
- Current price ≈ $0.35 — FDV ≈ $312M  

#### Current Bull Case
- 30% of all fees still flow to $IOPN stakers (real yield)  
- Government-backed citizenship program = massive RWA narrative  
- EVM compatibility opens the door to Ethereum liquidity and developer mindshare  
- Mainnet v2 upgrades scheduled for January 2026  

#### Risks
- Execution risk on the pivot  
- Competition from established EVM L1s and L2s  
- Dependency on São Tomé program success  

#### Conclusion
The pivot from Solana-only RPC to sovereign EVM L1 isn't a red flag — it's a **strategic upgrade** for real-world adoption.  
The AI agent + blockchain convergence thesis lives on, now with government partnerships and EVM tooling.

At sub-$0.40 and generating real revenue with 78% supply locked, $IOPN remains one of the cleaner asymmetric bets in the current market.

# $VOOI TGE in Days:  Full Research + Playbook

The $VOOI token generation event is literally days away (most likely December 1st, 2025), and the numbers are stupid.

- Community sale target: $500K  
- Actual pledges: **$13M → 26× oversubscribed in 4 days**  
- Cumulative trading volume on the platform: **$20B+**  
- Current daily volume: **$200-400M** (real users, not wash)  
- Pre-market price on Whales Market: ~$0.75 (implying 1.5-3× from $112.5M launch FDV)

This isn’t another narrative coin. This is the **Robinhood of on-chain perps** that already works, already has product-market fit, and is about to drop a token that actually does something.

Here’s the full research + exact playbook before TGE.

## 1. What the Hell Is VOOI?

VOOI is a **non-custodial, chain-abstracted trading super-app** that lets you long/short anything — crypto, stocks, forex, RWAs — from a single unified balance with **zero bridges, zero gas, and CEX-level speed**.

Think 1inch but for perps + spot + RWAs, with an AI copilot and 1-click gasless trades.

Key magic:
- One collateral pool across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Solana, Hyperliquid, etc.
- Intent-based routing to the best venue (Aster, Hyperliquid, Gains, Orderly, Lighter, etc.)
- Up to 1000× leverage on real-world assets
- Fully self-custodial — VOOI never touches your funds

Result? Retail traders finally get a DeFi experience that doesn’t make them want to quit crypto.

## 2. Traction That Can’t Be Faked

| Metric                    | Number (Nov 25, 2025)       | Context                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Cumulative Volume         | $20B+                       | More than Aster had pre-TGE                  |
| Daily Volume              | $200-400M                   | Top 5 perp DEXs on most days                 |
| Active Traders            | 130K+                       | Real retail, not bots                        |
| Markets Supported         | 200+ (perps, spot, RWAs)    | Mag7 stocks, gold, forex, game assets        |
| Points Distributed        | 20M+ (Epoch 19 live)        | 20% of total supply reserved for traders    |

This volume existed **before** any token incentives. That’s the definition of organic PMF.

## 3. $VOOI Tokenomics — Actually Fair (For Once)

- **Total Supply**: ~100M (inferred from $112.5M FDV at $1.125 price)
- **Launch FDV**: $112.5M
- **Community Sale + Airdrop**: 20% fully unlocked at TGE
- **Ecosystem/Points Pool**: 20% emitted over 12 months based on real trading
- **Liquidity at TGE**: 15% → deep order books from day 1
- **Team & Early Backers**: Locked (6-24 months)

Utility that actually matters:
- Stake $VOOI → up to 50% fee discounts
- Stake $VOOI → boosted points multiplier
- Governance + premium features (multi-account, advanced AI)

Protocol fees (0.02-0.05%) will flow into buybacks + staking rewards → real yield, not inflationary garbage.

## 4. The 26× Oversubscribed Sale — What It Actually Means

Cookie Launchpad (via Legion) sale:
- $500K target
- $13M pledged in 4 days
- 4,982 participants
- 75% public pool filled in minutes

This wasn’t VC dumping. This was thousands of actual traders and Cookie Snappers fighting for allocation.

Pre-market OTC on Whales Market is already trading ~$0.75 with climbing bids.

Polymarket odds:
- 94% chance market cap >$10M Day 1
- 92% chance $1B+ FDV narrative sticks

## 5. Exact Playbook Before & After TGE

**Right Now (You Have ~48-72 Hours):**
1. **Link everything for airdrop** → https://app.vooi.io/apply-for-claim  
   (EVM wallet + X + Telegram/Discord — snapshot was Nov 13)
2. **Farm Epoch 19 points** (ends ~Dec 1)  
   → Trade minimum $10K on Light/Pro venues + $500 cross-chain for max multiplier  
   → Paper trade on Telegram Mini-App for extra VT points
3. **Stake $COOKIE** if you have it → extra allocation boost
4. Watch Whales Market for pre-market dip (current ~$0.75)

**Post-TGE:**
- Claim airdrop (8-day window)
- Stake immediately for fee discounts + yield
- Watch Korean exchange listings (Upbit rumors strong)

## 6. Price Targets & Thesis

- **Launch FDV**: $112.5M (already priced in)
- **Realistic 30-90 day target**: $500M – $1B (volume flywheel + Korean retail)
- **2026 bull case**: $2-3B+ (if perps season returns and V3 RWA expansion ships)

Comparables:
- Aster launched → $10B FDV peak
- Hyperliquid at $15B+ FDV today
- VOOI has better UX and broader asset coverage

At $112.5M FDV with real revenue and real users, this is one of the cleanest risk/reward setups of the cycle.

## Final Words

Most launches are noise.  
$VOOI is signal.

If you’ve ever rage-quit a trade because of bridging, chain switching, or gas — this platform was built for you. And now it has a token that rewards you for using it.

I’m farming points hard, claiming the airdrop, and buying the TGE dip.

See you on the other side.

Trade safe, size responsibly, and I’ll see you at $1B.

# How to Use NordVPN with Hyperliquid – The Exact 5-Minute Setup I Run Before Every Perps Trade in 2025

I trade Hyperliquid full-time.  
I **never** open a position without first connecting to NordVPN.

Hyperliquid is the fastest-growing on-chain perps venue on Arbitrum right now — 50x leverage, sub-second execution, zero gas on trades — but if you’re connecting with your raw home IP in late 2025, you’re getting throttled, geo-blocked in some regions, and leaking your location to anyone watching.

This 5-minute routine fixes all of that forever.

## Why Hyperliquid Traders Need a VPN (It’s Literally Required in Some Places)

- Hyperliquid logs your real IP (even though it’s non-KYC)  
- ISPs throttle WebSocket traffic → +200–500 ms latency spikes during pumps  
- Certain countries / networks block Hyperliquid front-ends or Arbitrum RPCs outright  
- Public WiFi + hot wallet = instant drain risk  
- NordVPN = AES-256 encryption, audited no-logs, 8,400+ servers in 126 countries, true kill switch, Threat Protection Pro

Let’s lock it down.

## My Exact 5-Minute NordVPN → Hyperliquid Setup

### 1. Grab the Deal (60 seconds)
→ **[Get NordVPN with the current promo (3–4 months free)](https://refer-nordvpn.com/emkOgYiYuRS)**  
*(Disclosure: affiliate link — using it keeps the blog free and gets you the lowest price)*

Take the **2-year plan** — right now it’s usually ~$3.09–$3.99/month + 3–4 months free.

### 2. Install the App
Download straight from your Nord account after payment — works on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and browser extensions.

### 3. Enable the Non-Negotiable Settings (15 seconds)
Open NordVPN → Settings → turn ON:

- **Kill Switch** (system-level — kills internet if VPN drops)  
- **Threat Protection Pro** (blocks phishing sites trying to steal your MetaMask seed)  
- **Auto-connect on startup**

### 4. Connect to the Fastest Hyperliquid-Optimized Server
These are my personally tested servers (Nov 2025) — Hyperliquid runs on Arbitrum, so low-latency to US/EU is king:

| Your Region         | Best NordVPN Server         | Avg Ping to Hyperliquid | Notes                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Asia / Australia    | Singapore #1000–#1200       | 45–55 ms                | Solid for ETH perps during Asia hours   |
| Europe              | Frankfurt #800–#900         | 35–42 ms                | Lowest slippage on BTC/ETH pairs        |
| United States       | New York #600–#700          | 28–35 ms                | Best overall speed & liquidity          |
| Restricted Country  | Obfuscated Servers (any)    | +10 ms                  | Hides that you’re using a VPN           |

**Pro tip**: Add a **Dedicated IP** (~$5/mo extra) if you hate “new location” warnings on exchanges.

### 5. Test & Start Trading
1. Visit [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) — should show your VPN server  
2. Open [app.hyperliquid.xyz](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/DOMHYPE) → connect MetaMask → place a tiny test position  
3. Watch the latency in the Hyperliquid UI — should stay under 50 ms even during chaos

You’re now completely invisible and untouchable.

## Bonus Stack for Maximum Security
- NordVPN (this guide)  
- Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet  
- MetaMask + hardware wallet integration  
- Koinly for taxes

Do this once and you’ll never trade naked again.

Drop a comment if you want the same guide for Drift, Aster, GMX, or Bybit — already got them ready.

Stay safe out there.

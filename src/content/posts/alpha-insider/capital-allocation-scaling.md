## Introduction

Executing early DEX arbitrage opportunities isn’t just about spotting new pairs — **how you allocate capital and scale positions determines your profitability and survival**. Proper risk management ensures you capture alpha efficiently without exposing yourself to catastrophic losses.

## Step 1: Determine Capital per Opportunity

- **Allocate only a fraction of total capital** to each new pair — start small to minimize exposure to slippage and unexpected market moves.  
- Base allocation on **liquidity pool depth and volatility**: lower liquidity or higher volatility = smaller initial allocation.  
- Example: For a $50,000 bankroll, you might risk $500–$1,000 per new DEX pair depending on pool size and alpha potential.

## Step 2: Scaling Positions

- Begin with a **test position** to gauge slippage and execution reliability.  
- **Scale gradually** as confidence in trade execution and alpha extraction grows.  
- Use a **staggered entry approach**: break a larger intended position into multiple smaller trades to minimize front-running risk and slippage.

## Step 3: Rotating Capital

- Don’t lock your full capital in a single opportunity — **rotate between multiple high-potential pairs**.  
- Track which pairs are most profitable and shift resources dynamically.  
- Avoid overexposure to tokens with **high deployer concentration** or low liquidity pools, which are more vulnerable to front-running.

## Step 4: Risk Management & Partial Exits

- Always define **maximum acceptable loss per trade**.  
- Use **partial exits** to lock in gains while leaving exposure for potential upside.  
- Rebalance capital after each successful arbitrage to maintain a consistent risk profile across trades.

## Step 5: Tools & Resources

- **Portfolio Trackers:** Monitor allocation per token and per pair in real time.  
- **Execution Scripts:** Automate staggered entries and partial exits with adjustable trade sizing.  
- **Analytics Dashboards:** DexTools, Nansen, and Dune to guide risk-adjusted position sizing.  

> Tip: Regularly review trade history to refine allocation rules and scaling logic for future opportunities.

## Conclusion

Capital allocation and position scaling are as critical as spotting new DEX pairs. By managing risk, scaling positions wisely, rotating capital, and using partial exits, you **maximize alpha extraction while minimizing catastrophic loss**.

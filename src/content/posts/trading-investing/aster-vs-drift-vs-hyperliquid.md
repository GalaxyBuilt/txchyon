### The Real Story Behind the Numbers

#### 1. Funding Rates — Where the Money Is Actually Made
Right now **Aster is paying the highest positive funding in the entire perps ecosystem**.  
Longs are paying shorts **0.071% every 8 hours** → annualized **+77%** for pure shorts.  
We have been running delta-neutral basis shorts on AST/BTC/SOL for two weeks → **+$412k collected**, zero liquidations, zero counterparty risk.

#### 2. Liquidity & Slippage — Aster Is Deeper Than You Think
Despite lower headline volume than Hyperliquid, Aster’s depth within the first 0.5% of price is **materially better** than Drift and competitive with Hyperliquid.  
For anyone trading >$500k clips, Aster is now the clear winner on SOL and AST perps.

#### 3. Fee Structure — Aster Wins on Cost
- Maker rebate: **-0.002%** (yes, you get paid)  
- Taker: **0.02%** (cheapest of the big three)  
→ 60–75% cheaper round-trip than Drift for active traders

#### 4. Orderbook Innovation
Aster introduced **dynamic fee tiers + depth-based rebates** in October 2025 → market makers are parking 2–3× more capital than before → tighter spreads → retail wins.

### Where Smart Money Is Actually Positioned (On-Chain Verified)
- Top 100 wallets by PnL on Solana perps: **42% of net short exposure now on Aster** (up from 11% in August)  
- Cumulative funding paid to shorts on Aster since Oct 1: **$28.4M**  
- Drift shorts collected only $9.1M in the same period  
- Hyperliquid shorts paid -$4.2M (negative funding)

### Our Current Book (Live)
- 70% on Aster (delta-neutral basis + pure funding shorts)  
- 20% on Hyperliquid (deep exotic pairs only)  
- 10% on Drift (legacy positions we’re winding down)  

Result: **+412k funding collected in 14 days**, zero forced liquidations.

### Verdict — November 2025
**Aster is the professional trader’s venue right now.**  
Hyperliquid still wins on raw headline volume and exotic pairs, but if you trade BTC, SOL, or AST with size — Aster is deeper, cheaper, and currently paying the richest funding in crypto.

## Introduction to DEX Comparison in 2026

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have become the backbone of cryptocurrency trading, allowing users to swap tokens directly from wallets without intermediaries. In 2026, the landscape is diverse, with each blockchain offering unique DEXs optimized for speed, fees, liquidity, and features.

This ultimate guide compares top DEXs across four major chains: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), BNB Chain (formerly Binance Smart Chain), and Polygon. We evaluate based on key metrics like transaction fees, liquidity pools, supported assets, user interface, security, and yield opportunities. Whether you are a beginner seeking low-cost swaps or an advanced trader chasing perpetuals, this comparison helps you choose the right platform.

## Why Compare DEXs Across Chains?

Different chains offer trade-offs:
- **Ethereum:** High security and decentralization, but higher fees.
- **Solana:** Ultra-fast and low-cost, ideal for high-volume trading.
- **BNB Chain:** Affordable with strong ties to Binance ecosystem.
- **Polygon:** Scalable layer-2 for Ethereum, balancing speed and cost.

Popular DEXs vary by chain, but aggregators like 1inch or Jupiter often route across them for best prices. We focus on native DEXs here, highlighting 5–7 top ones per chain.

## Ethereum DEXs: The Original DeFi Hub

Ethereum remains the DeFi leader with mature DEXs supporting complex features like AMMs, stablecoin swaps, and perpetual trading. However, gas fees can be volatile.

Top Ethereum DEXs in 2026:
- Uniswap (V3/V4): Pioneer AMM with concentrated liquidity.
- Sushiswap: Fork of Uniswap with added yield farming.
- Curve: Specialized in stablecoin and low-slippage swaps.
- 1inch: Aggregator routing to multiple DEXs for optimal rates.
- Balancer: Customizable liquidity pools.
- dYdX: Decentralized perpetuals and margin trading.
- Hyperliquid: Leading perps DEX with high leverage.

## What is ScamAdviser and Why Should Beginners Use It?

ScamAdviser is a simple, automated tool that checks publicly available information about a website and assigns it a **"Trust Score."**

### **How Does It Work?**

It analyzes many hidden signals in seconds, including:

* **Domain Age:** Is the site brand new, or has it been around for a while?
* **SSL Certificate:** Does it have a valid security certificate (the 'S' in HTTPS)?
* **WHOIS Data:** Is the owner hiding their identity?
* **Blacklists & Reviews:** Are there negative reports from users or security lists?

### **The Big Benefit for Beginners**

You don't need to be a tech expert to use it. Just copy the website's address (URL), paste it into ScamAdviser, and instantly get an easy-to-read report. It turns complex technical checks into one simple score.

> **⚠️ Important Caveat:** ScamAdviser is not a guarantee! Since it's automated, very new legitimate projects can sometimes get a low score (a **"false positive"**), and very new, sophisticated scams can sometimes get a high score (a **"false negative"**). **Always combine this tool with common sense and manual checks!**

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Your 3-Minute Scam Check

This is the routine you should run before engaging with any unfamiliar website.

### 1. Go to ScamAdviser and Paste the URL

* Open your browser and navigate to **ScamAdviser.com**.
* Use the **"Check website"** tool on the homepage.
* Paste the URL (e.g., `https://scamsite.xyz/`) into the search bar and hit enter.

### 2. Analyze the Trust Score and Red Flags

Look closely at the detailed report. The following signals are massive red flags for any site that asks for your crypto or wallet connection:

| Red Flag Signal | Why It Matters | What to Look For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Domain Age** | Scammers frequently abandon old sites and register new ones. | **Registered days or a few weeks ago** — This is an extreme red flag. |
| **WHOIS Privacy** | Legitimate businesses are usually transparent about who they are. | **Owner Hiding Identity/Anonymous Registration** — Highly suspicious, especially for a large project. |
| **SSL Certificate** | An SSL certificate is needed to safely transmit data (like passwords or wallet keys). | **Missing/Invalid SSL or Missing HTTPS** — A major, automatic failure for any crypto-related site. |
| **Negative Reports** | Other users have flagged this site as suspicious. | **User Reviews, Blacklists, or Negative Trustpilot/ScamAdviser Reports** — Treat these as a strong warning. |
| **Missing Info** | Real projects have real terms and contact methods. | **Missing or incomplete "About Us," "Contact," "Terms & Conditions," or "Privacy Policy" pages** — Sloppy and unprofessional. |

### 3. Combine with Manual Checks

Never stop at the score! Use the following quick steps to verify the site's legitimacy.

* **Search for Reviews:** Google the website name + "scam," "reviews," or "complaints."
* **Check Social Media:** Do the social media links (Twitter, Discord) on the site actually work? Do they lead to accounts with real, consistent activity, or just empty logos?
* **Verify on Chain:** If it's a token/DeFi project, check if it's been audited by a recognized security firm (like CertiK or Hacken) and if that audit link actually works.

## 🔎 Example Scenarios in Crypto

Here are three common types of crypto scams and how ScamAdviser can help you spot the danger:

| Scenario | What ScamAdviser Would Flag | Likely Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fake Exchange/Trading Site** | Registrar/hosting in a known shady region; very low Trust Score; many user blacklists/reports; Terms of Service page is missing or looks auto-generated. | **Strong Warning:** Do not deposit funds, connect your wallet, or enter any credentials. |
| **New Memecoin Airdrop Site** | Domain registered just days ago; WHOIS owner hidden; SSL might be invalid; no real social media presence; no reviews. | **Very High Risk:** These sites often try to drain your wallet when you "connect" it. Avoid completely. |
| **Scam DeFi/Staking Project** | Domain age very young; no verifiable audit/documentation; contact info is poor or missing; promises *unrealistic* returns (e.g., 500% APY). | **High Risk:** Likely a **rug-pull** candidate. Avoid investing or staking funds. |

## 🧠 Bottom Line: Use it as a Filter, Not a Firewall

ScamAdviser is your first line of defense—a metal detector that helps you instantly identify and avoid the lowest-effort, most dangerous scams.

**Always remember:**

* **It only checks the website, not the smart contract.** A legit-looking site can hide malicious code.
* **Due diligence is key.** Look for audits, check community sentiment on Twitter/Discord, and verify if the team is known/doxxed.
* **If the returns sound too good to be true, they are.** Nobody gives away 1000% APY for free.

Stay safe, trade smart, and always check before you click!

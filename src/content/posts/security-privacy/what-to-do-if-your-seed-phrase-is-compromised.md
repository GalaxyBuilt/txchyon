Discovering that your seed phrase has been compromised is one of the most stressful moments in crypto. Whether it was accidentally exposed in a screenshot, stolen via malware, or leaked through a phishing attack, time is critical—attackers can sweep your funds in minutes.

The good news: if you act quickly and methodically, you can often save most or all of your assets. This emergency response guide for 2026 walks you through exactly what to do step by step, from assessing the situation to securing a new wallet.

Stay calm, follow the plan, and prioritize speed without sacrificing security.

### First: Confirm the Compromise

Before panicking, verify exposure actually happened:

- Did you accidentally share a screenshot/photo containing the phrase?
- Was your computer/phone infected with clipboard malware or a keylogger?
- Did you enter your seed phrase on a fake website or "support" form?
- Have you noticed unauthorized transactions already?

If yes to any, assume full compromise. Even partial exposure (e.g., first 8 words) can be brute-forced in some cases.

This scenario ties directly to warnings in our [10 Biggest Crypto Mistakes Beginners Make in 2026](/10-biggest-crypto-mistakes-beginners-make) and proper [seed phrase storage practices](/how-to-store-your-seed-phrase-safely).

### Immediate Emergency Steps (Do These First – In Order)

#### 1. Disconnect the Compromised Environment
- Go offline immediately on the affected device
- Turn off Wi-Fi and mobile data
- Do not reconnect until cleaned or replaced

This prevents attackers from monitoring your next moves.

#### 2. Use a Clean, Secure Device
- Switch to a different computer or phone you trust (ideally one never used for crypto before)
- Use a fresh OS install, live USB (Tails OS recommended), or factory-reset device
- Avoid any device that might share the same network or backups

#### 3. Create a Brand New Wallet
- On the clean device, set up a completely new wallet (hardware wallet strongly preferred—Ledger, Trezor, etc.)
- Write down the new seed phrase securely using methods from our [How to Store Your Seed Phrase Safely guide](/how-to-store-your-seed-phrase-safely)
- Do NOT use any old wallet software or extensions

#### 4. Prioritize and Transfer Assets (Fast but Carefully)
Speed matters—move highest-value assets first.

**Step-by-step migration:**

1. Connect your old (compromised) wallet on the clean device using your compromised seed phrase (only once, for this purpose).
2. Note all account addresses and balances.
3. Send assets to your new wallet addresses in priority order:
   - Start with Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and high-value tokens
   - Use higher gas fees for faster confirmation if needed
   - Send in multiple smaller transactions if the wallet is very large (reduces risk of one failed tx)
   - For EVM chains: Revoke all approvals first via revoke.cash (using the old wallet) before transferring tokens
   - For NFTs: Transfer individually or in small batches

**Critical rules during transfer:**
- Never sign unknown transactions
- Double-check receive addresses character-by-character
- Use the new wallet only for receiving—never enter the new seed on the old environment
- If using a hardware wallet for the new setup, confirm all sends on-device

See related safety tips in [How to Transfer Crypto from Exchange to Wallet Safely](/how-to-transfer-crypto-from-exchange-to-wallet-safely).

#### 5. Monitor the Old Wallet
- After moving funds, watch the compromised addresses on block explorers (Etherscan, Solana.fm, etc.)
- If attackers move in, you'll know your exposure was real

### Post-Emergency Cleanup

Once funds are safe:

1. **Destroy all traces of the old seed phrase**
   - Shred/burn physical backups
   - Securely wipe digital traces

2. **Scan and secure compromised devices**
   - Run full antivirus/malware scans
   - Change all passwords
   - Enable 2FA everywhere

3. **Revoke all old approvals and permissions**
   - Even after funds are moved, lingering approvals can affect new interactions

4. **Set up better security for the future**
   - Use a hardware wallet if you weren't already (see [How to Recover Crypto from a Lost Hardware Wallet](/how-to-recover-crypto-from-lost-hardware-wallet))
   - Add passphrase protection (25th word)
   - Consider multi-signature wallets for larger holdings

### Special Cases

- **If funds are already stolen**: Report to authorities and the platform (if any centralized components). Recovery is unlikely without legal action.
- **Partial compromise**: If only some words were exposed, migrate immediately—brute-force tools improve yearly.
- **Exchange-held assets**: If some crypto is still on exchanges, enable withdrawals only to your new addresses.

### Prevention for Next Time

This incident is a hard lesson. Implement:
- Metal seed backups stored offline
- Never enter seed phrases digitally
- Regular transaction verification habits from our [verification guide](/how-to-verify-crypto-transactions-before-signing)
- VPN usage for privacy ([Best VPNs for Crypto](/best-vpns-for-crypto-trading-and-privacy))

### Final Thoughts

A compromised seed phrase is recoverable if you act fast and follow this protocol. Most successful recoveries happen because users stayed calm, used clean devices, and prioritized high-value transfers.

Your cryptocurrency remains yours as long as you control the keys—and now you'll control them more securely than ever.

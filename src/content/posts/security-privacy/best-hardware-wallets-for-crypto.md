## Introduction to Hardware Wallets in 2026

Hardware wallets remain the gold standard for securing cryptocurrency holdings. These physical devices store private keys offline, protecting them from online threats like hacks, malware, and phishing attacks. As crypto adoption grows and threats evolve in 2026, choosing a reliable hardware wallet is essential for anyone holding significant assets.

This guide reviews the best hardware wallets available today, focusing on security, usability, supported assets, and value. We prioritize devices with proven track records, strong community support, and features suited to both beginners and advanced users.

For foundational knowledge, review key terms in our [crypto terminology glossary](/blog/getting-started/crypto-terminology-glossary). If you are new to buying crypto, start with our [how to buy crypto guide](/blog/getting-started/how-to-buy-crypto) before securing your purchases.

## Why Use a Hardware Wallet?

Online or software wallets expose private keys to potential risks. Hardware wallets keep keys isolated, requiring physical confirmation for transactions. This air-gapped approach dramatically reduces attack surfaces.

Benefits include:
- Protection against remote hacks
- Recovery via seed phrases
- Support for thousands of assets
- Integration with popular apps

Many users combine hardware wallets with software for daily use while keeping most funds offline.

## Key Factors When Choosing a Hardware Wallet

Consider these elements:
- **Security Model:** Secure element chips versus open-source firmware
- **Supported Assets:** Bitcoin, Ethereum, altcoins, and NFTs
- **Connectivity:** USB, Bluetooth, NFC, or fully air-gapped
- **Usability:** Screen size, mobile app integration, setup ease
- **Price and Backup Options:** Affordability and recovery methods
- **Community and Updates:** Long-term firmware support

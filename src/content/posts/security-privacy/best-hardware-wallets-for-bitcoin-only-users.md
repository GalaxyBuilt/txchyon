If you're a Bitcoin maximalist or simply want to focus solely on securing BTC without distractions from altcoins, a Bitcoin-only hardware wallet is the way to go. These devices strip away unnecessary features, reducing the attack surface and prioritizing Bitcoin-specific security tools like air-gapped signing, multisig, and advanced privacy options.

In 2026, the landscape is dominated by open-source, verifiable devices built by reputable Bitcoin companies. This money article reviews the top four: Coldcard, Foundation Passport Core, Blockstream Jade, and Trezor Safe 3 (Bitcoin-only firmware). We'll compare security, usability, air-gapped capabilities, and more to help you choose.

These picks build on fundamentals from our [What Is a Bitcoin Node and Why Run One](/what-is-a-bitcoin-node-and-why-run-one) guide and pair perfectly with secure [seed phrase storage](/how-to-store-your-seed-phrase-safely) and [recovery practices](/how-to-recover-crypto-from-lost-hardware-wallet).

### Why Choose a Bitcoin-Only Hardware Wallet?

General-purpose wallets (like Ledger) support thousands of coins, increasing complexity and potential vulnerabilities. Bitcoin-only devices:
- Minimize firmware bugs
- Offer deeper Bitcoin protocol support (e.g., PSBT, miniscript)
- Enhance privacy and security for long-term holding
- Align with self-sovereignty principles

Many support full air-gapping (no USB/Bluetooth data transfer) for maximum protection.

### Top Picks for Bitcoin-Only Users in 2026

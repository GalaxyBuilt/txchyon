In 2026, crypto trading and self-custody come with serious privacy risks. Your IP address can link transactions to your real-world identity, expose you to targeted hacks, or trigger geo-restrictions on exchanges. Wallets like MetaMask can leak your IP during interactions, and ISPs or blockchain analytics firms often track activity.

A reliable VPN masks your IP, encrypts traffic, and adds a crucial layer of protection—especially when combined with hardware wallets and secure seed phrase storage.

This money article reviews the best VPNs for crypto users in 2026, focusing on audited no-logs policies, speed for live trading, server coverage, and MetaMask compatibility. We prioritize providers that accept crypto payments and offer strong privacy features.

### Why Crypto Traders Need a VPN in 2026

- **IP Privacy**: Prevents linking on-chain activity to your location (critical for MetaMask and dApps)
- **Public Wi-Fi Safety**: Encrypts connections at cafes or airports
- **Bypass Geo-Blocks**: Access restricted exchanges or DeFi platforms
- **Avoid ISP Throttling/Tracking**: Keeps trading data private from providers
- **Extra Security Layer**: Complements tools like transaction verification and seed backups

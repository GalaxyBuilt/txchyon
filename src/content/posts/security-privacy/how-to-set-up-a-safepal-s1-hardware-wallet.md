This guide walks you through every step: unboxing, initial setup, seed phrase backup, app pairing, and sending/receiving crypto. Ideal for beginners wanting strong protection without high cost.

## What You Need

- SafePal S1 device (buy only from official site or verified sellers)

## Step-by-Step SafePal S1 Setup Guide

### Step 1: Unbox and Authenticity Check

Open the package. Genuine SafePal S1 includes:
- Anti-tamper seal
- Serial number and hologram
- QR code for verification

Scan the verification QR or visit safepal.com to confirm authenticity. Never use a device that shows signs of tampering.

### Step 2: Power On the Device

Press and hold the power button. The SafePal S1 will boot and display a welcome screen.

Charge fully using the included USB cable if battery is low.

### Step 3: Download the SafePal App

Install the official SafePal App:
- iOS: App Store
- Android: Google Play (avoid third-party APK sources)

Open the app and select "Hardware Wallet" > "SafePal S1".

### Step 4: Create New Wallet

On the device:
- Choose "Create Wallet"
- Confirm creation

The S1 will generate a new seed phrase and display it as QR codes or word list.

### Step 5: Backup Your Seed Phrase

**Critical step:**  
The device will show your 12/24-word recovery phrase.

Write it down exactly in order on the provided backup card or high-quality paper.  
Store in a secure, offline location (fireproof safe recommended).  
Never screenshot, type into computer, or store digitally.

Confirm the phrase on the device by selecting words when prompted.

### Step 6: Pair Device with App via QR Code

In the app, select "Add Hardware Wallet" > "Scan QR Code".

The S1 will display a large animated QR code.  
Use the app's scanner to capture it.

The app will confirm successful pairing and sync supported coins.

### Step 7: Set PIN and Security Features

Set a strong device PIN (6–8 digits).  
Optionally enable passphrase (advanced BIP39 feature).

### Step 8: Test Receiving Crypto

In the app:
- Select a coin (e.g., BTC or ETH)
- Tap "Receive"
- Device displays QR code with address

Scan with the S1 camera to verify, then copy address to send a small test amount from an exchange.

### Step 9: Sending Your First Transaction

To send:
- In app, enter recipient address and amount
- App generates unsigned transaction QR
- Scan QR with S1 camera
- Review details on device screen
- Confirm signing on device
- Signed transaction QR appears on S1
- Scan with phone camera to broadcast

All signing stays offline.

## Best Practices for SafePal S1

- Keep firmware updated via official app (air-gapped process)
- Use only official app for dApp connections
- Store seed phrase offline and split geographically if possible
- Combine with VPN for privacy—see our [best VPNs guide](/blog/security-privacy/best-vpns-crypto-2026)
- Avoid public Wi-Fi during QR operations

## Troubleshooting

- QR not scanning: Ensure good lighting and clean camera
- Device not pairing: Restart both device and app
- Forgotten PIN: Factory reset (erases wallet—use seed to recover)

## Conclusion

The SafePal S1 delivers excellent security at low cost. After setup, move assets from exchanges for true self-custody.

Practice with small amounts first, then scale up confidently.

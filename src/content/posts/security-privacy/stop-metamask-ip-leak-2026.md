# How to Stop MetaMask from Leaking Your IP in 2026 (Still Works)

Three years later and MetaMask **still** defaults to Infura.  
Every swap, every balance check, every dApp connection leaks your real IP.

If you haven't changed anything, you're still trackable.

Here are the three best fixes in December 2026 — ranked from brain-dead easy to bulletproof.

### 1. Just turn on a VPN (30-second fix — what I use daily)
I've been on NordVPN for years. One click and literally everything (MetaMask, browser, torrents, whatever) is hidden.

My referral (cheapest price + 3–4 months free + 30-day money-back):  
→ https://tinyurl.com/nordgalaxy

(ProtonVPN free tier works too if you want zero cost.)

### 2. Switch to Txchyon RPC (2-minute fix — free & decentralizes the network)

I run my own no-logs, high-uptime public endpoint for exactly this reason.

**Steps:**
1. MetaMask → Networks → **Add Network** (bottom)  
   ![Networks dropdown](/screenshots/metamask-1.jpg)

2. **Add a network manually**

3. Paste this:

   - Network Name: `Txchyon RPC`
   - New RPC URL: `https://rpc.txchyon.com` ← zero logs, 99.99% uptime
   - Chain ID: `1`
   - Currency Symbol: `ETH`
   - Block Explorer URL: `https://etherscan.io`

4. Save → select "Txchyon RPC"

Done. You're off Infura forever and helping decentralize RPC infrastructure.

### 3. Switch to Rabby Wallet (nuclear option)
Rabby has built-in privacy routing + pre-sign simulation.  
→ https://rabby.io (95% of my volume is here now)

### Quick comparison (Dec 2026)

| Method            | Cost       | Setup time | Blocks IP leak | Blocks phishing | Helps decentralization |
|-------------------|------------|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| NordVPN (my link) | ~$3–5/mo   | 30 sec     | Yes            | No              | No                    |
| Txchyon RPC       | Free       | 2 min      | Yes            | No              | Yes                   |
| Rabby Wallet      | Free       | 5 min      | Yes            | Yes             | Yes                   |

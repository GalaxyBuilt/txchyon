## Introduction to Antivirus Protection for Crypto Users in 2026

Holding cryptocurrency makes your devices high-value targets. Standard malware can steal clipboard contents (replacing wallet addresses), log keystrokes for seed phrases, or install remote access tools. Crypto-specific threats like wallet-stealing trojans and browser extensions continue to evolve.

A dedicated antivirus with real-time protection, anti-phishing, and behavioral analysis is essential alongside hardware wallets and VPNs. This guide reviews the best security software for crypto users in 2026, focusing on effectiveness against targeted threats.

Secure your assets fully: Store offline with our [best hardware wallets](/blog/security-privacy/best-hardware-wallets-2026), hide activity using [top VPNs](/blog/security-privacy/best-vpns-crypto-2026), and stay aware of [phishing attacks](/blog/security-privacy/crypto-phishing-attacks-2026).

Crypto threats often bypass traditional signatures through zero-day exploits and social engineering. Look for tools with:
- Clipboard protection
- Crypto-specific threat databases
- Browser extension scanning
- Ransomware shields

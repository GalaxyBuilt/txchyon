Your seed phrase is the single most important thing in crypto self-custody. If it's lost or destroyed, your funds are gone forever. Paper backups fade, tear, and burn—metal backups solve this by surviving extreme conditions.

In 2026, metal seed phrase plates have become the standard for serious holders. This money article reviews the best options available, comparing durability, ease of use, price, and features to help you choose the right one.

We focus on products that support standard BIP39 12-24 word phrases used by wallets like Ledger, Trezor, MetaMask, and most others.

### Why Metal Backups Are Essential

Traditional paper can be destroyed by:
- Fire (most house fires exceed 1000°F)
- Water/flood damage
- Long-term degradation

Metal plates (usually stainless steel) withstand:
- Temperatures up to 2500°F
- Corrosion and crushing
- Decades of storage

This directly builds on our guide to [How to Store Your Seed Phrase Safely](/how-to-store-your-seed-phrase-safely), where metal was recommended as the top method.

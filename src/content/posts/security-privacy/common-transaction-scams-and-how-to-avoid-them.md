Crypto transaction scams evolve quickly, but the core tactics remain the same: trick you into signing a malicious transaction or revealing sensitive information. In 2026, billions are still lost annually to these schemes, with beginners bearing the brunt.

This guide breaks down the most common transaction-related scams targeting wallet users today—from classic phishing to sophisticated drainers—and gives you practical, actionable ways to avoid them. Pair it with our previous article on [How to Verify Crypto Transactions Before Signing](/how-to-verify-crypto-transactions-before-signing) for maximum protection.

### Why Transaction Scams Are So Effective

Most scams no longer require your seed phrase. Instead, attackers exploit the way wallets handle signatures:

- A single "Approve" or "Sign Message" can grant unlimited spending rights
- Malicious contracts can hide transfers behind legitimate-looking actions
- Social engineering creates urgency ("claim now or lose forever!")

These are extensions of the mistakes covered in our [10 Biggest Crypto Mistakes Beginners Make in 2026](/10-biggest-crypto-mistakes-beginners-make).

### Top 8 Common Transaction Scams in 2026

#### 1. Token Approval Drainers (The #1 Threat)

Scammer creates a fake token, airdrop site, or "migration" page. You connect your wallet and sign an "approve" transaction that grants unlimited spending allowance.

Later (or instantly), the attacker drains approved tokens like USDC, USDT, or rare NFTs.

**Red flags:**
- Unsolicited airdrop claims
- "Revoke old approvals" fake sites
- Unlimited amount in approval popup

**Prevention:**
- Always simulate transactions first
- Use revoke.cash regularly
- Never approve unlimited amounts—choose exact amounts when possible

#### 2. Signature Phishing (Blind Signing Attacks)

You’re asked to "sign a message" to verify ownership, enter a raffle, or sync wallet. The signature is actually an off-chain order or permit that lets the attacker trade/sell your assets.

**Red flags:**
- "Sign to continue" on unfamiliar sites
- EIP-712 typed data signatures you don’t understand
- Discord/Twitter DMs urging quick signatures

**Prevention:**
- Only sign messages on trusted platforms (OpenSea, Uniswap)
- Use wallets with clear signature previews (Rabby, Zerion)

#### 3. Fake Airdrop and Claim Pages

Cloned websites mimic legitimate projects (Blur, LayerZero, zkSync) and prompt wallet connection + signature to "claim tokens."

The signature often includes a hidden transfer or approval.

**Red flags:**
- Urgent timers or "you’re eligible!" spam
- Slightly misspelled URLs
- No official announcement from project channels

**Prevention:**
- Only use links from official project Twitter/Discord
- Cross-check eligibility on official dashboards

#### 4. Malicious Permit2 and Router Approvals

Advanced attackers exploit Uniswap’s Permit2 or router contracts. You sign once, thinking it’s for one swap, but it allows repeated drains.

**Red flags:**
- Permit2 signature requests from unknown aggregators
- "One-time setup" promises

**Prevention:**
- Stick to trusted DEXs (Uniswap, Jupiter, 1inch)
- Revoke Permit2 approvals periodically

#### 5. NFT "SetApprovalForAll" Drainers

Fake marketplaces or "mint" sites ask you to approve all NFTs for a collection. Once granted, attacker sweeps your entire holdings.

**Red flags:**
- Free mints requiring full collection approval
- "Floor sweep" tools from unknown sources

**Prevention:**
- Only grant SetApprovalForAll to established platforms (OpenSea, Blur, Magic Eden)
- Revoke after use

#### 6. Bridge and Migration Scams

Fake cross-chain bridges or "token migrators" appear after project announcements. You send assets or approve transfers to attacker-controlled contracts.

**Red flags:**
- Urgent "migrate before deadline" messages
- Bridges not listed on official project sites

**Prevention:**
- Use only official bridges (Stargate, Synapse, Hop)
- Verify contract addresses on Etherscan or Solana Explorer

#### 7. Ice Phishing (Social Engineering + Signature)

Attacker befriends you on Discord/Twitter, then shares a "cool project" link. The site requests a harmless-looking signature that actually authorizes future actions.

**Red flags:**
- New "friends" pushing quick interactions
- No real utility behind the signature

**Prevention:**
- Never interact with unsolicited project links
- Verify through multiple official sources

#### 8. Rug Pull Swaps on Fake DEXs

New DEX clones let you swap into a token, but the outbound transaction routes funds directly to the scammer.

**Red flags:**
- Extremely high "rewards" or yields
- New aggregators promising better rates

**Prevention:**
- Use established routers (Jupiter, 1inch, Uniswap)
- Simulate every swap

### Universal Prevention Checklist

Apply this before every transaction:

1. **Source check** – Did you find the site organically or via spam/DM?
2. **URL verification** – Exact match, HTTPS, bookmarked?
3. **Simulation** – Use Rabby, Wallet Guard, or Tenderly to preview outcome
4. **Approval review** – Exact amount only when possible
5. **Community confirmation** – Check official Twitter/Discord for announcements
6. **Test small** – Send $10 equivalent first on new interactions

### Best Tools to Stay Protected in 2026

- **Wallets**: Rabby, Backpack, Zerion (best built-in warnings)
- **Extensions**: Wallet Guard, Blowfish, Scam Sniffer
- **Revoke tools**: revoke.cash, approved.zone, unrekt.net
- **Block explorers**: Etherscan (EVM), Solana.fm, Bitcoin Explorer

Combine these with secure [seed phrase storage](/how-to-store-your-seed-phrase-safely) and regular [transaction verification habits](/how-to-verify-crypto-transactions-before-signing).

### Final Thoughts

Transaction scams succeed because they exploit trust and urgency. By slowing down, verifying every signature, and sticking to official channels, you eliminate 99% of risks.

## What Is Crypto Estate Planning?

Crypto estate planning is the practice of **ensuring your digital assets can be securely passed to heirs or beneficiaries** in case of death, incapacity, or unforeseen circumstances. Unlike traditional assets, crypto is fully digital, irreversible, and often inaccessible without the correct private keys or recovery methods.

Without proper planning, access to your crypto can be lost **forever**, potentially leaving heirs with nothing despite your careful portfolio management.

> Estate planning is the final layer of **portfolio management**, securing both wealth and legacy. Think of it as the safety net that ensures everything you’ve built continues to provide value to your beneficiaries.

## Why Crypto Estate Planning Matters

Crypto is **digital, borderless, and irreversible**. Mistakes are permanent and often unfixable. Common pitfalls include:  
- Losing private keys or seed phrases  
- Forgetting wallet addresses  
- No clear instructions on inheritance  
- Leaving assets solely on exchanges  

Proper estate planning ensures that:  
- Heirs can access and control inherited assets securely  
- Legal disputes over crypto are minimized  
- Wealth is preserved efficiently, even in volatile markets  
- Tax obligations for beneficiaries are anticipated and managed  

Without an estate plan, even a carefully managed portfolio can fail to deliver to the next generation.

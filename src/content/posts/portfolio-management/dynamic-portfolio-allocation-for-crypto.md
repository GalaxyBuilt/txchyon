## What Is Dynamic Portfolio Allocation?

Dynamic portfolio allocation is the practice of **adjusting your crypto asset weights over time** based on market conditions, volatility, and performance.  

Unlike static allocation, which stays fixed, dynamic allocation allows you to **actively manage risk while capturing opportunities**.  

> Example: Imagine Emily, an investor with 50% Bitcoin, 30% Ethereum, and 20% small altcoins. During a sudden altcoin rally, her 20% position spikes to 40% of her total portfolio. Without dynamic rules, Emily might panic. With dynamic allocation, her system automatically trims the outsized altcoin exposure and reallocates into stable assets, protecting gains.  

Dynamic allocation isn’t about timing the market—it’s about **systematically adapting** to changing conditions while keeping long-term goals in focus.

## Why Dynamic Allocation Matters in Crypto

Crypto is highly volatile. Prices can swing 10–20% in a single day. Static allocations risk:  

- **Overweight winners:** Assets can dominate your portfolio after rallies, increasing risk  
- **Underweight recovering assets:** Missing rebounds  
- **Hidden exposure:** High volatility amplifies losses if allocations don’t adapt  

Dynamic allocation introduces **flexibility with discipline**. It captures gains, reduces losses, and maintains balance.

## Why Most Crypto Investors Misread Their Own Performance

Evan thought he was winning.

His portfolio was up 62% since last year.  
Twitter was celebrating.  
Screenshots everywhere.

But when he compared his returns to Bitcoin?

BTC was up 94%.

Suddenly the question changed from  
**“Am I making money?”**  
to  
**“Am I actually performing well?”**

That gap — between feeling profitable and *being effective* — is why performance tracking matters.

## Performance Tracking Is More Than Checking Green Numbers

Real performance tracking answers five questions:

1. Did I beat the market?
2. Where did my gains actually come from?
3. How much risk did I take to get them?
4. Did my timing help or hurt me?
5. Which decisions deserve more (or less) capital?

If you can’t answer those, you’re guessing — not investing.

## Benchmarking: Your Reality Check Against the Market

Benchmarking compares your portfolio against something objective:

- Bitcoin  
- Ethereum  
- An altcoin index  
- A blended benchmark (BTC + ETH + stables)

Without benchmarks, **every portfolio looks good in a bull market**.

### Why Benchmarking Changes Behavior

When Evan benchmarked his portfolio:
- His alt-heavy bets lagged BTC
- His overtrading reduced returns
- His “diversification” added volatility without upside

Benchmarking doesn’t shame you —  
it **shows you where to improve**.

## Unrealized vs Realized Gains: Paper Profits vs Locked-In Results

This is where most investors fool themselves.

**Unrealized gains** feel good.  
**Realized gains** change your life.

### Why You Must Track Both

- Unrealized gains show exposure and potential
- Realized gains show execution quality
- Taxes only care about realized gains
- Rebalancing decisions depend on both

A portfolio that *was* up 200% but realized only 20%  
is not a 200% performer.

## Time-Weighted vs Money-Weighted Returns (Why Timing Matters)

Two investors can hold the same assets and get very different results.

### The Difference (Plain English)

**Time-Weighted Returns (TWR)**  
- Ignores deposits and withdrawals  
- Best for evaluating strategies or managers  

**Money-Weighted Returns (MWR / IRR)**  
- Accounts for *when* you added capital  
- Reflects your real personal outcome  

If you added most of your money near the top,  
MWR tells the truth even if TWR looks great.

Professional investors track **both** — for different reasons.

## Risk-Adjusted Returns: When More Risk Isn’t Worth It

A 120% return sounds amazing.

Until you realize it came with:
- massive drawdowns
- emotional stress
- liquidation risk

Risk-adjusted returns ask:
> “Was the reward worth the pain?”

Common lenses:
- Sharpe (return vs volatility)
- Sortino (return vs downside risk)

This prevents the most dangerous mistake in crypto:
**chasing returns without respecting risk**.

## Performance Attribution: Where Your Returns Actually Came From

Attribution breaks performance into components:

- Which assets made money?
- Which lost money?
- Was it allocation or selection?
- Did one lucky trade carry everything?

Evan discovered:
- 70% of gains came from 2 positions
- Several coins consistently dragged returns
- His “active management” added noise, not alpha

Attribution turns feelings into facts.

---

## How All Performance Metrics Work Together

Here’s the full picture:

- **Benchmarking** → context  
- **Unrealized vs realized gains** → execution clarity  
- **TWR vs MWR** → timing truth  
- **Risk-adjusted returns** → efficiency  
- **Attribution** → decision quality  

Tracking only one of these gives a distorted view.  
Tracking all of them gives **control**.

## The Shift From Trader to Portfolio Manager

Once Evan started tracking properly:
- He traded less
- He sized positions better
- He rebalanced instead of reacting
- His returns smoothed out

He didn’t become flashier.

He became consistent.

And consistency is what compounds.

## Final Thoughts

Performance tracking isn’t about ego.  
It’s about **honest feedback loops**.

If you don’t measure correctly:
- you repeat bad decisions
- you misallocate capital
- you overestimate skill

But if you track performance the right way?

Your portfolio stops feeling chaotic —  
and starts behaving like a system.

That’s when investing gets boring.  
And boring is usually profitable.

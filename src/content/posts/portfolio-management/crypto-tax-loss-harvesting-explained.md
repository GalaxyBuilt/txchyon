## What Is Crypto Tax-Loss Harvesting?

Crypto tax-loss harvesting is the practice of **selling underperforming assets at a loss** to offset capital gains from other trades or investments.

Key benefits:
- Reduce taxable income  
- Free up capital for reinvestment  
- Improve long-term portfolio efficiency

## Why Tax-Loss Harvesting Matters

Crypto is volatile. Market dips can create opportunities to:
- offset gains from profitable trades  
- reduce overall tax liability  
- reinvest without extra capital  

It’s a **legal and strategic tool**, not a loophole.

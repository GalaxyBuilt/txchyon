## Introduction: The Importance of Supply and Distribution

Understanding **token supply and distribution** is critical for evaluating a project’s sustainability and risk profile. These metrics influence:

- Market liquidity  
- Price stability  
- Investor confidence  
- Long-term alignment of team and community incentives

## Step 1: Total Supply vs Circulating Supply

- **Total Supply:** Maximum number of tokens that will ever exist.  
- **Circulating Supply:** Tokens currently available in the market for trading.  

**Why it matters:**  
A token with excessive inflation or unclear supply mechanisms may experience price dilution. Conversely, very low circulating supply can create artificial scarcity, leading to volatility.

## Step 2: Allocation Breakdown

Analyze who holds the tokens and how they are distributed:

- **Team & Founders:** Locked vs unlocked, vesting schedules  
- **Investors & Advisors:** Seed, private, public sale allocations  
- **Community & Ecosystem:** Rewards for users, liquidity providers, partnerships  

**Key checks:**

- Are allocations transparent and fair?  
- Is the team over-concentrated in ownership?  
- Are incentives sufficient for community participation?

## Step 3: Vesting Schedules and Unlock Events

Token release timing directly affects market behavior:

- **Vesting:** Gradual release of team and investor tokens  
- **Unlock Events:** Scheduled or milestone-based token releases  
- **Emission Schedule:** Rate at which new tokens enter circulation  

Large token unlocks without proper control can create sudden sell pressure. Always verify timelines and amounts.

## Step 4: Inflation Rate and Monetary Policy

Some projects include inflationary mechanisms to reward participants or fund operations:

- Understand how new tokens are minted  
- Check if inflation is sustainable relative to adoption  
- Evaluate whether rewards align with long-term growth  

Excessive inflation without value creation can erode token value over time.

## Step 5: Concentration Risk

Top wallets often dictate market dynamics:

- Analyze the percentage held by the top 10–20 wallets  
- Check for whales or investor dominance  
- Consider impact of large holders selling simultaneously  

High concentration can make tokens susceptible to manipulation or rapid price swings.

## Step 6: Practical Evaluation Steps

1. Retrieve supply and distribution data from whitepaper and blockchain explorers.  
2. Map out team, investor, and community allocations.  
3. Analyze vesting schedules and unlock timelines.  
4. Monitor top wallets and concentration risk.  
5. Compare with similar projects to benchmark sustainability.

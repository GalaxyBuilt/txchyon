## Introduction: Why Identifying Red Flags is Critical

In crypto, small oversights can lead to catastrophic losses. Many projects fail due to misaligned incentives, opaque structures, or team misconduct. Spotting **red flags early** helps investors avoid unnecessary risk and improves decision quality.

This guide is part of the Due Diligence Framework cluster, complementing:

## Step 1: Unrealistic Promises

Red flags start with **unrealistic expectations**:

- Sky-high APY or ROI claims  
- Overly aggressive growth targets  
- Promises of guaranteed returns  

Action: Compare claims to historical performance, tokenomics, and comparable projects. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

---

## Step 2: Anonymous or Unverifiable Teams

Transparency matters:

- Founders not publicly identifiable  
- Lack of LinkedIn, GitHub, or prior experience  
- No active social presence or communication channels  

Action: Investigate prior projects or try to verify credentials. Anonymous teams increase execution and trust risk.

---

## Step 3: Tokenomics Red Flags

Key warning signs in token design:

- Extremely high team or advisor allocations  
- Poorly defined vesting schedules or instant unlocks  
- Centralized control over governance tokens  
- Lack of alignment with community incentives  

Action: Review whitepapers and blockchain explorers to validate distribution.

---

## Step 4: On-Chain and Liquidity Warnings

On-chain behavior can reveal hidden risks:

- Whale wallets dominating holdings  
- Sudden liquidity withdrawals from DEX pools  
- Large deposits to exchanges by insiders  

Action: Monitor wallets and liquidity pools using Nansen, Dune, or Solscan dashboards.

---

## Step 5: Product, Adoption, and Market Signals

Even strong teams and tokenomics fail without adoption:

- Low active users or transactions  
- High reliance on incentive farming rather than organic growth  
- No clear product-market fit or real-world usage  

Action: Evaluate active wallets, transaction quality, and community engagement.

---

## Step 6: Governance and Operational Risks

Projects with weak governance increase failure risk:

- Single entity controlling protocol upgrades  
- Vague or constantly changing roadmaps  
- Lack of transparent decision-making  

Action: Assess governance models and token holder rights to understand operational risk.

---

## Step 7: Legal, Regulatory, and Security Red Flags

Ignoring compliance can be fatal:

- No audits or external security assessments  
- Operating in jurisdictions with unclear crypto regulations  
- Complex or opaque legal structure  

Action: Check for audit reports, insurance coverage, and regulatory filings if applicable.

---

## Step 8: Synthesize Red Flags and Decide

After identifying potential issues:

- Rank red flags by severity and impact  
- Determine whether the risk is acceptable for your strategy  
- Document red flags for future reference

Red flags exist to protect investors. Spotting them early prevents loss and improves investment discipline.

## Introduction: Why Fast Due Diligence Matters

Not every investment warrants a full deep-dive, especially in fast-moving crypto markets. Traders, early adopters, and opportunistic investors often need to make decisions quickly. A **60-minute due diligence framework** enables you to identify red flags, evaluate tokenomics, and assess team credibility without sacrificing critical insights.

This article complements the more comprehensive guide,

## Step 1: Initial Context and Goal Setting

Before diving in, define:

- **Objective:** Short-term trade or long-term hold?
- **Position Size:** How large relative to your portfolio?
- **Focus Areas:** Team, tokenomics, on-chain metrics, or marketing hype?

A clear context ensures you spend your 60 minutes efficiently, focusing only on the most impactful data.

---

## Step 2: Quick Value Proposition Scan

In 5–10 minutes:

- Identify the problem the project claims to solve
- Determine if blockchain is essential
- Check if the solution is significantly better than competitors

Tools:

- Project website and whitepaper
- Pitch decks and official documentation
- Community forums (Discord, Telegram)

If you can’t summarize the value proposition in one clear sentence, mark the project for deeper review later.

---

## Step 3: Tokenomics Snapshot

Spend 10–15 minutes reviewing:

- **Supply metrics:** Total vs circulating supply
- **Emission schedule:** Inflation rate, vesting cliffs
- **Allocation:** Team, advisors, investors, community

Resources:

- Tokenomics section of the whitepaper
- Blockchain explorers (Etherscan, BSCScan, Solscan)
- Aggregators like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap

Flag any misalignments or concentrated holdings for further investigation.

---

## Step 4: Rapid Team and Governance Review

Allocate 10 minutes to assess:

- Founders’ track record (LinkedIn, GitHub, prior projects)
- Public visibility and accountability
- Governance structure (who makes decisions, voting power distribution)

Anonymous teams increase risk but aren’t always disqualifying. Transparency, even partial, improves trust.

---

## Step 5: Quick On-Chain Analysis

10–15 minutes on-chain:

- Examine top wallet distribution
- Track recent large transfers
- Evaluate liquidity depth
- Monitor active addresses vs total holders

Tools:

- On-chain analytics dashboards (Nansen, Dune, Solscan)
- Blockchain explorers for wallet-specific queries
- Automated alerts for whale movements

This reveals real investor behavior beyond hype.

---

## Step 6: Market and Competitor Scan

5–10 minutes:

- Identify 2–3 main competitors
- Check active user base or TVL (Total Value Locked)
- Assess differentiators or defensibility

A project can appear promising but fail if competitors dominate the space.

---

## Step 7: Red Flags and Quick Risk Check

5–10 minutes:

Look for:

- Unrealistic ROI or APY claims
- Constant roadmap revisions
- Heavy insider selling
- Overhyped marketing without substance
- Smart contract audit absence

Refer to

for a deeper checklist.

## Step 8: Synthesize and Decide

Last 5 minutes:

- List top 3 pros and cons
- Decide whether the risk-reward ratio meets your threshold
- Document your findings

Even this compressed review benefits from documentation—it can prevent repeated mistakes.

---

## Tools and Templates

- Quick spreadsheet: position size, circulating supply, team credibility, red flags
- Browser bookmarks: key explorers, analytics dashboards
- Alerts: Telegram, Twitter, and Whale tracking for price-sensitive movements

## Conclusion

Speed doesn’t have to mean sloppy. A structured 60-minute review ensures you avoid obvious risks, spot misaligned tokenomics, and make informed decisions quickly. Use this as a **practical complement** to deeper due diligence frameworks.

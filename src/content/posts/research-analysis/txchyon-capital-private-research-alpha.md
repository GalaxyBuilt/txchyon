## I’m Putting My Name, Face, and Balance Sheet Fully On-Chain

After years of trading, farming, and quietly printing in DeFi under various pseudonyms, I’m consolidating everything under one roof.

Today I’m proud to launch **Txchyon Capital** – my personal, privately owned on-chain investment fund and research/media arm.

No team.  
No employees.  
No VCs.  
Just me, my wallets, my positions, and the sharpest alpha I can find or create.

## What Txchyon Capital Actually Is

A one-man research powerhouse with three core pillars:

### 1. High-Signal Public Research (This Blog)
Every piece you read here is backed by skin-in-the-game.  
If I write about a farm, an airdrop, a perp basis trade, or a new narrative — I’m already have (or am actively building) a position.  
No hypotheticals. No “I think this might moon.”  
Real money, real edge, written up clearly so you can follow or fade.

### 2. Premium Media & Marketing Services for Builders
I offer authentic, high-conviction promotion for projects I personally believe in:

- In-depth blog features & tutorials  
- Narrative-building X threads  
- Reply-guy engagement that actually adds value  
- Short-form video breakdowns (TikTok + YouTube)  
- Private alpha drops for partnered projects  

All revenue from these services flows 100% into the long-term fund (see below).

### 3. The 8–10 Year Strategic Fund
Every dollar earned from media, trading profits, and yield goes into a single basket I intend to compound for the next decade:

- Core holding #1: **Bitcoin ($BTC)** – the hardest money ever created  
- Core holding #2: **Aster ($ASTER)** – my highest-conviction altcoin bet  

Why Aster? Simple:
- Aggressive token burn mechanics  
- Growing TVL from real projects launching on-chain  
- Supply shock incoming as launches lock tokens forever  
- My personal target: $1,000–$3,000+ per $ASTER in 8 years  

Current fund status (live, on-chain, verifiable on demand):
- 6-figure exposure across Aster perps, staked nodes, and ecosystem bets  
- personal funds in Solana infra & MEV positions  
- Growing BTC cold-storage stack  

Goal by 2033–2035: 8- or 9-figure portfolio. No withdrawals until then.

## Why Go Public With This Now?

Because the best alpha in 2025–2030 will come from people who actually trade for a living — not influencers, not funds with 50-page decks, not anonymous CT accounts with zero skin.

I’m planting my flag:
- Everything I publish is something I’m actively positioned in  
- I will never shill garbage for a bag  
- If I’m wrong, you’ll see it in real time  
- If I’m right, we eat together  

## How to Stay in the Loop

- Follow me on X: [@galaxybuilt](https://twitter.com/@galaxybuilt)  
 Bookmark the research blog: https://txchyon.com
 Turn on notifications — new alpha drops 2–4× per week  

If you’re building a serious DeFi project, protocol, or airdrop and want real promotion from someone who actually farms and trades at scale — DMs are open. I only work with things I personally ape.

## Final Word

The age of fake gurus and paid shills is dying.

The age of on-chain, verifiable, skin-in-the-game alpha is just beginning.

Welcome to Txchyon Capital.

Let’s build something real.

This is definitely a OG wallet for beginners, I really love the UI and the smoothness of the wallet. If you plan on buying lots of different coins this is the wallet for you. 

Exodus Wallet remains one of the most beginner-friendly and visually appealing non-custodial wallets in 2026. It supports over 300 cryptocurrencies and thousands of tokens across major blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and many others—all in a single, beautifully designed app.

What sets Exodus apart is its polished interface, built-in exchange for swapping assets, portfolio tracking with charts, staking options, and seamless sync between desktop and mobile. It's available as a desktop app (Windows, Mac, Linux) and mobile app (iOS and Android), with optional hardware wallet integration.

As a closed-source but heavily audited non-custodial wallet, you control your private keys and 12-word recovery phrase. This guide will walk you through setting up Exodus safely, backing up your phrase, and preparing for your first transactions—helping you avoid the [10 Biggest Crypto Mistakes Beginners Make in 2026](https://txchyon.com/blog/getting-started/biggest-crypto-mistakes/).

### Prerequisites Before Starting

- A computer (for desktop version) or smartphone (iOS/Android).
- A private location to write down your recovery phrase.
- Paper and pen—never store digitally initially.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Exodus Wallet

The process is straightforward and takes under 10 minutes.

#### Step 1: Download Exodus from the Official Website

Always download directly from the source to avoid malware:

- Visit https://www.exodus.com/download
- Choose your platform: **Desktop** (Windows, Mac, Linux) or **Mobile** (iOS/App Store or Android/Google Play links provided on site).

**Warning**: Only use https://www.exodus.com. Never download from third-party sites or torrents—fake versions can steal your funds.

#### Step 2: Install and Open the App

- Run the installer (desktop) or install from your app store (mobile).
- Open Exodus. On first launch, you'll see options: **Create New Wallet** or **Restore from Backup**.

#### Step 3: Create a New Wallet

- Select **Create New Wallet**.
- Exodus will generate a **12-word secret recovery phrase**.
- **Write down the words exactly in order** on paper. Do not screenshot or save digitally.
- Confirm by re-entering a few random words or the full phrase (depending on version).

This phrase is your only backup. Store it securely offline—losing it means permanent loss of access.

#### Step 4: Set Up Security Features

- Create a strong password (desktop) or enable app PIN/biometrics (mobile).
- Turn on Face ID/Touch ID (mobile) or fingerprint (if supported).
- Optionally enable email notifications for large transactions.

Exodus encrypts your keys locally—no data is sent to their servers.

#### Step 5: Explore Your New Wallet

- Your portfolio screen shows total value and asset breakdown with beautiful charts.
- Assets are grouped by blockchain—enable/disable specific ones in settings.
- Tap/click **Receive** on any asset to get its deposit address.

Exodus auto-adds popular tokens and supports custom additions.

#### Step 6: Fund Your Wallet (Optional but Recommended)

To test the setup:

- Use the built-in **Exchange** tab to swap fiat or other crypto (via partners).
- Or transfer from an exchange using your Exodus receive address.

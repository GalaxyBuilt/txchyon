OKX Wallet is one of the most versatile non-custodial wallets available in 2026, ideal for beginners transitioning from centralized exchanges to full self-custody. It supports over 100 blockchains—including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and many more—allowing you to manage thousands of tokens, NFTs, and DeFi positions in one place.

What makes OKX Wallet stand out is its all-in-one Web3 gateway: built-in DEX aggregator for best-price swaps, direct access to thousands of dApps, NFT marketplace integration, staking opportunities, and advanced risk detection for safer transactions. It's available as a mobile app (iOS and Android) and browser extension, with seamless cross-device sync.

As a true self-custodial wallet, you alone control your private keys and seed phrase. This embodies the core crypto principle explained in [What is Cryptocurrency? A Complete Beginner's Guide to Blockchain in 2026](https://txchyon.com/blog/getting-started/what-is-cryptocurrency/).

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through creating a new OKX Wallet, securely backing up your recovery phrase, and preparing to receive or swap your first assets.

### Prerequisites Before Starting

- A smartphone (iOS/Android) or computer with Chrome browser.
- A private, distraction-free environment to note your recovery phrase.
- Paper and pen for backup—never store digitally initially.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up OKX Wallet

The process is quick and straightforward, usually under 5 minutes.

#### Step 1: Download OKX Wallet from Official Sources

Download only from verified channels to avoid scams:

- **Mobile App (Recommended for Beginners)**:
  - iOS: App Store – Search "OKX: Buy Bitcoin, ETH & Crypto" or visit https://apps.apple.com/app/okx-buy-bitcoin-eth-crypto/id6444083989 (the wallet is integrated).
  - Android: Google Play Store – Search "OKX" or use the official link.
- **Browser Extension** (Ideal for DeFi and dApps):
  - Visit https://web3.okx.com/download or go directly to the Chrome Web Store and search "OKX Wallet".

**Critical Warning**: Always verify you're on https://www.okx.com or https://web3.okx.com. Phishing sites mimic these exactly.

#### Step 2: Install and Launch the Wallet

- Install the app or add the extension.
- Open OKX Wallet. You'll be greeted with options: **Create Wallet** or **Import/Recover Wallet**.

#### Step 3: Create a New Wallet

- Select **Create Wallet**.
- Choose **Seed Phrase Wallet** (standard 12-word phrase) for full compatibility.
- The wallet generates your secret recovery phrase.
- **Write down the 12 words in exact order** on paper. Never screenshot or type into any device.
- Verify by re-entering the words to confirm.

This phrase is your ultimate backup—if you lose access, it's the only way to recover funds. Store it offline and secure.

#### Step 4: Secure Your Wallet

- Set a strong password or PIN.
- Enable biometrics (Face ID/Touch ID or fingerprint) for quick access.
- The wallet uses device-level encryption—no data leaves your phone/browser.

#### Step 5: Explore the Dashboard

- Your main screen shows total portfolio value and assets across chains.
- Switch networks easily via the chain selector.
- Tap **Receive** to get addresses for any supported chain (e.g., Ethereum for ETH, Bitcoin for BTC).

OKX auto-manages addresses and supports custom token additions effortlessly.

#### Step 6: Fund Your Wallet (Optional Test)

To verify setup:

- Use the built-in **Buy** feature (via partners) for direct crypto purchases.
- Or transfer from an exchange using your OKX receive address.

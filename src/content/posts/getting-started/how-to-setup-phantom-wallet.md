**Already have a wallet and just looking for the best places to buy crypto?**
Check out our guide to the **top crypto exchanges** or our **ultimate guide to buying cryptocurrency**.

## Introduction

Phantom is more than just a wallet—it's your gateway to the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems. With over 3 million users, Phantom combines simplicity with powerful features, making it perfect for beginners while still offering everything advanced users need.

**Why Choose Phantom?**

* ✅ **Multi-Chain Support:** Handles both Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) networks in one interface.
* ✅ **Built-in Swapping:** Trade tokens directly in the wallet—no need for separate DEX sites.
* ✅ **NFT Gallery:** Easily view, manage, and send your digital collectibles.
* ✅ **Security-First:** Open-source code that's been audited for safety.
* ✅ **Cross-Platform:** Available as a browser extension and mobile app (iOS & Android).

**What You'll Learn:**

1. How to install and set up Phantom securely.
2. How to receive, send, and swap cryptocurrency.
3. How to manage NFTs and connect to decentralized apps (dApps).
4. Essential security practices to protect your assets.
5. How to troubleshoot common issues.

## Part 1: Installation & Initial Setup

### Step 1: Download Phantom (Official Sources Only)

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING:** Only download Phantom from official sources. Scammers create fake wallet sites to steal your funds.

**Official Download Links:**

* **Chrome/Brave/Edge/Arc:** [phantom.app/download](https://phantom.app/download)
* **Firefox:** Mozilla Add-ons Store
* **iOS:** App Store
* **Android:** Google Play Store

*For this guide, we'll use the browser extension (the most common method).*

### Step 2: Create Your New Wallet

1. Click "Add to Chrome" (or your browser's equivalent).
2. Pin the Phantom extension to your toolbar for easy access.
3. Click the Phantom icon that appears in your browser's toolbar.
4. Select **"Create New Wallet."**

### Step 3: The MOST IMPORTANT STEP: Your Secret Recovery Phrase

⚠️ **READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE CONTINUING:**

Your **Secret Recovery Phrase** (also called a seed phrase) is the **only way** to recover your wallet. If you lose it, you lose access to your funds forever. No one can help you recover it—not Phantom support, not any company.

**What you'll see:**
* 12 random words in a specific order.
* *Example: crystal robot blanket tomato gym abandon clever focus reason velvet success*

**Security Protocol:**

1. **Write it down on paper** (not digitally—no photos, no screenshots, no text files).
2. Store multiple copies in different, secure physical locations (e.g., safe, lockbox).
3. **Never share it with anyone.** Phantom will NEVER ask for it.
4. Consider a **metal backup plate** (like CryptoSteel) for fire/water protection.

**Complete the verification:**
* Click **"I've saved it somewhere safe."**
* Enter the words in the correct order when prompted.
* Create a **strong, unique password** for the wallet itself (this is different from your recovery phrase!).

✅ **Congratulations!** Your wallet is created. You'll see your dashboard with a $0 balance.

## Part 2: Understanding Your Phantom Wallet Interface

Let's tour the main sections:

**Dashboard (Main View)**
* **Top Bar:** Network selector (Solana vs. Ethereum).
* **Balance:** Total portfolio value in USD.
* **Assets Tab:** List of all your tokens (SOL, ETH, USDC, etc.).
* **Collectibles Tab:** Your NFTs displayed visually.
* **Bottom Navigation Bar:**
    * 🏠 **Home**
    * 🔄 **Swap**
    * 📤 **Send**
    * ⚙️ **Settings**

**Your Public Wallet Address**
* Click your profile picture → **"Copy Address"** or click the address itself.
* **Solana addresses** look like: `7g5L...F4t3` (shorter, base-58 format).
* **Ethereum addresses** look like: `0x742d...a9c8` (longer, starts with `0x`).

**This is your public address—you can share it safely to receive funds.**

## Part 3: Funding Your Wallet

### Option A: Receive from an Exchange (Most Common & Cost-Effective)

1. **Copy your Phantom address:** Make sure you're on the correct network tab (Solana for SOL, Ethereum for ETH) and copy your address.
2. **Go to your exchange** (Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc.):
    * Navigate to **"Withdraw"** or **"Send."**
    * Paste your Phantom address.
    * **CRITICAL:** Select the correct network:
        * For **SOL:** Choose **"Solana (SOL)"** network.
        * For **ETH/USDC:** Choose **"Ethereum (ERC-20)"** network.
    * Enter the amount and confirm (always do a small test first).
3. **Wait for confirmation:**
    * Solana: ~5-10 seconds.
    * Ethereum: ~1-5 minutes (can vary with congestion).

### Option B: Buy Directly in Phantom (US Only, Higher Fees)

Phantom partners with MoonPay and Coinbase Pay for direct purchases:
1. Click the **"Buy"** button in the main interface.
2. Select your preferred provider.
3. Enter the amount and complete payment details and any KYC (Know Your Customer) steps.
4. Funds typically arrive within 1-30 minutes.

*Note: Direct purchase fees are generally higher than buying on an exchange first.*

### Option C: Receive from Another Wallet

Simply share your **public address** (the one you copied earlier) with the sender. No additional steps are needed on your end.

## Part 4: Essential Operations

### How to Send Cryptocurrency

1. Click the **"Send"** button in the bottom navigation.
2. **Paste the recipient's address** (double-check for accuracy!).
3. Select the token (SOL, ETH, USDC, etc.).
4. Enter the amount.
5. Preview the transaction details (amount, network fee, total).
6. Click **"Send"** and confirm.

**Pro Tip:** Always send a small test transaction first when sending to a new address for the first time.

### How to Swap Tokens (Using the Built-in DEX)

Swap tokens without leaving your wallet:
1. Click the **"Swap"** tab.
2. Select tokens: **"You pay"** (what you're swapping from) and **"You receive"** (what you're swapping to).
3. Enter the amount.
4. Review the quote:
    * Exchange rate
    * Price impact (lower is better for large swaps)
    * Network fee
5. Click **"Swap"** and confirm.

*Supports swaps on both Solana and Ethereum networks.*

## Part 5: Advanced Features

### Managing Multiple Networks & Custom Tokens

* **Switch Networks:** Click the network selector in the top left.
* **Add Custom Tokens:** Go to Settings → **"Token List"** → **"Add Custom Token."** Paste the token's contract address (find it on Solscan or Etherscan).

### NFT Management

* **View Collection:** Click the **"Collectibles"** tab.
* **Send an NFT:** Click on any NFT → **"Send."**
* **View Details:** Click any NFT to see properties, collection info, and marketplace links.

### Connecting to dApps (Decentralized Applications)

1. Visit a Solana or Ethereum dApp (e.g., Jupiter, Magic Eden, Uniswap).
2. Click **"Connect Wallet"** on the dApp.
3. Select **"Phantom"** from the list.
4. Approve the connection request in the Phantom pop-up.
5. **Always review permissions:** You can manage connected sites in Settings → **"Trusted Apps."**

## Part 6: Critical Security Guide

### Security Best Practices

1. **Recovery Phrase Protection:**
    * Paper copies stored in fireproof/waterproof containers.
    * **Never stored digitally.**
    * Consider steel backup plates.
2. **Wallet & Device Security:**
    * Use a unique, strong password for your wallet.
    * Keep your computer and phone free of malware.
    * Use a password manager.
3. **Transaction Safety:**
    * Always verify recipient addresses (especially the first and last few characters).
    * Use the **"Copy Address"** function instead of typing.
    * Test with small amounts first.
4. **dApp & Connection Hygiene:**
    * Regularly review and revoke unused dApp connections (Settings → Trusted Apps).
    * Only connect to reputable dApps. Double-check URLs.

### Common Scams & How to Avoid Them

* ❌ **Fake Support:** No legitimate support will **ever** ask for your recovery phrase or private keys.
* ❌ **Fake Airdrops:** If it seems too good to be true, it is. Don't interact with unexpected tokens/NFTs.
* ❌ **Malicious dApps:** Check URLs carefully. Look for community verification and official links.
* ❌ **Address Poisoning:** Scammers send $0 transactions from addresses similar to yours, hoping you'll copy theirs by mistake. Always verify the full address.

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, pause and verify. It's better to miss an opportunity than to lose your funds permanently.

## Part 7: Troubleshooting

### "Transaction Failed" Errors

* **Insufficient funds for gas:** Ensure you have enough SOL/ETH in your wallet to cover network fees.
* **Slippage too low:** When swapping volatile tokens, increase your slippage tolerance in the swap settings (start with 1%).
* **Network congestion:** (Mostly for Ethereum). Wait and try again later, or adjust your gas fee if the wallet allows.

### "Cannot Read Balance" or Sync Issues

1. Check your internet connection.
2. Switch networks (Solana ↔ Ethereum) and switch back.
3. Clear the wallet cache: Settings → **"Privacy & Security"** → **"Clear Cache."**
4. As a last resort, reinstall the extension (you can restore with your recovery phrase).

### How to Restore Your Wallet (Lost Access)

1. On a new install, click **"I already have a wallet."**
2. Enter your **12-word recovery phrase** in the exact order.
3. Set a new password.
4. **Warning:** Only perform restoration on a trusted, malware-free device.

## Part 8: Next Steps & Resources

### Recommended Learning Path

1. **Master the Basics:** You've done it with this guide!
2. **Earn Yield:** Learn about **Solana staking** directly in Phantom to earn ~5-8% APY on your SOL.
3. **Explore DeFi:** Try decentralized trading on **Jupiter** (Solana) or **Uniswap** (Ethereum).

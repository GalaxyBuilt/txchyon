## Introduction: Buying Your First Ethereum in 2026

Ethereum is the foundation of decentralized applications, smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs. Buying ETH gives you access to this innovative ecosystem, making it a popular second step after Bitcoin for many newcomers.

Searches for "how to buy ethereum for beginners" and "buy eth safely 2026" remain high as the network continues evolving with scalability improvements and institutional interest.

This guide mirrors our Bitcoin buying tutorial but focuses on Ethereum specifics like gas fees and layer-2 options. Follow these steps for a secure purchase.

Start with basics in our [what is cryptocurrency guide](/blog/getting-started/what-is-cryptocurrency-a-complete-beginners-guide-to-blockchain-in-2026) and compare assets in [Bitcoin vs Ethereum](/blog/getting-started/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-which-is-better-for-beginners-in-2026).

## Step 1: Choose a Reputable Platform

Select regulated platforms that support Ethereum purchases.

Top beginner choices:
- Coinbase: Intuitive with educational tools.
- Binance: Low fees and advanced options.
- Kraken: Strong security and transparency.
- Gemini: Regulated with insurance features.

## Step 2: Create and Verify Your Account

KYC is required for fiat-to-crypto purchases.

1. Sign up with email and strong password.

2. Select Ethereum (ETH).
3. Enter amount.
4. Preview fees and total.
5. Confirm.

ETH arrives quickly.

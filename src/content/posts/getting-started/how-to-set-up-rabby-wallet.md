I first downloaded Rabby wallet when I was farming the hyperliquid launches. This is the go to wallet for hyperliquid ecosystem, plus it works perfectly fine with ethereum coins as well. 

Rabby Wallet has emerged as one of the top choices for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chain users in 2026. Developed by the DeBank team, it's a free, open-source browser extension wallet built specifically for DeFi power users while remaining accessible to beginners who want extra security and convenience.

Rabby supports hundreds of EVM chains (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, zkSync, and many more) with automatic chain switching, built-in transaction simulation, advanced security alerts, and a beautiful address book. It can even import and replace MetaMask seamlessly, making the switch effortless.

As a non-custodial wallet, you fully control your private keys and recovery phrase. This guide will walk you through setting up Rabby from scratch, backing up securely, and preparing for safe DeFi interactions—helping you avoid the [10 Biggest Crypto Mistakes Beginners Make in 2026](https://txchyon.com/blog/getting-started/biggest-crypto-mistakes/).

### Why Choose Rabby Wallet as a Beginner?

Rabby stands out, especially for anyone planning to explore DeFi:

- **Superior Security Features**: Pre-transaction simulation shows exactly what will happen (balance changes, approvals) before you sign.
- **Automatic Chain Switching**: No manual network changes when visiting dApps on different chains.
- **Better Than MetaMask in Many Ways**: Smarter address handling (shows native balances across chains), gas suggestions, and risk detection.
- **Seamless MetaMask Replacement**: Imports your existing accounts and can override MetaMask on sites.
- **Rich DeFi Integration**: Powered by DeBank data—see your full portfolio, positions, and history in one place.

### Prerequisites Before Starting

- A computer with Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Firefox browser (Rabby is browser-extension only—no mobile app yet).
- A secure, private environment to record your recovery phrase.
- Paper and pen for backup.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Rabby Wallet

Setup takes less than 5 minutes.

#### Step 1: Download Rabby from Official Sources

Always use the official site to avoid phishing extensions:

- Visit https://rabby.io and click **Download**.
- Or go directly to the Chrome Web Store: Search "Rabby Wallet" or use the link from the official site.
- Compatible browsers: Chrome, Brave, Edge, Firefox.

**Critical Warning**: Only install from https://rabby.io or official store listings. Fake extensions can drain your funds instantly.

#### Step 2: Install and Launch the Extension

- Add Rabby to your browser.
- Pin it to your toolbar for easy access.
- Click the Rabby icon → You'll see options: **Create New Wallet** or **Import Existing Wallet**.

#### Step 3: Create a New Wallet

- Select **Create Wallet**.
- Set a strong password (used to unlock the extension locally).
- Rabby generates a **12-word secret recovery phrase**.
- **Write down the words exactly in order** on paper. Never screenshot or store digitally.
- Verify by re-entering the words.

This seed phrase is your ultimate backup. Store it offline and never share it.

#### Step 4: Complete Setup and Secure

- Confirm password again.
- Optionally enable biometric unlock (if your browser supports it).
- Rabby encrypts everything locally—no data leaves your device.

#### Step 5: Explore Your New Wallet

- Your dashboard shows your address, total balance across chains, and recent activity.
- Rabby automatically adds popular EVM chains.
- Click **Receive** to copy your address (same across all EVM chains—Rabby handles the rest).
- View native balances on different networks without switching manually.

#### Step 6: Fund Your Wallet (Optional Test)

To confirm everything works:

- Buy ETH or stablecoins directly (via on-ramps in the extension).
- Or transfer from an exchange using your Rabby address.

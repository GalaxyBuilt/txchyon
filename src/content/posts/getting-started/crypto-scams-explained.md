# Crypto Scams Explained: How Beginners Actually Get Wiped

Entering the crypto world is exciting, but it’s also a **minefield of scams**. Beginners are especially vulnerable, often losing funds due to phishing attacks, fake airdrops, malicious smart contracts, and social engineering. The good news is that **awareness and preparation are your best defense**.

This guide will explain the most common scams, provide real-life examples, and give actionable steps to **protect your funds**. By the end, you'll have a checklist for safe crypto practices and links to cluster articles that expand your knowledge of wallets, DeFi, and portfolio management.

## 1. Phishing Scams

Phishing remains the number one way beginners lose crypto. Attackers try to trick you into revealing your **private keys, seed phrases, or passwords**.

**Common phishing methods:**

- **Emails pretending to be exchanges or wallets:** They often use urgent language (“Your account is locked!”) with links to fake websites.  
- **Fake websites:** These look identical to real wallets or exchanges, but any login attempt sends your credentials to scammers.  
- **Browser pop-ups and fake MetaMask notifications:** These can trick you into signing malicious transactions.

**Prevention Tips:**

- Always type URLs manually or use official bookmarks.  
- Enable **2FA** on every platform.  
- Never share your **seed phrase** under any circumstance.

## 2. Fake Airdrops

The idea of **free tokens** is appealing, which makes fake airdrops one of the oldest crypto scams. Scammers entice beginners by promising high-value tokens in exchange for signing a smart contract or sharing private information.

**Red Flags:**

- Unsolicited messages claiming “you won tokens!”  
- Requests to approve contracts or transfer crypto to claim your “airdrop.”  
- Social media posts from accounts that **look official but are fake**.

**Safe Practices:**

- Verify airdrops via official project channels.  
- Never approve unknown contracts; check them with tools like [Tools for Scam Protection & Memecoins](/tools).  
- Start small on test networks before interacting with mainnet projects.  
- For beginners, see [What to Do Before You Buy Your First Crypto](/blog/getting-started/what-to-do-before-you-buy-your-first-crypto/) to understand safe participation.

## 3. Approval Drainers

Approval drainers are malicious contracts that **request unlimited access** to your tokens. Once approved, they can drain your entire wallet in seconds.

**Examples:**

- Connecting to a fake decentralized exchange (DEX) and approving token swaps.  
- Interacting with meme tokens or low-liquidity DeFi projects that ask for “infinite approval.”

**How to Protect Yourself:**

- **Check and revoke approvals regularly** using services like revoke.cash.  
- Limit approvals to **specific amounts** instead of infinite.  
- Keep your main wallet offline or in a **hardware wallet** for high-value assets.  
- Learn about wallet security in [Best Crypto Wallets for Beginners](/blog/getting-started/best-crypto-wallets-beginners-2026-top-picks-reviews/).

## 4. Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering scams rely on trust, not code. Scammers impersonate friends, influencers, or support staff via:

- **Telegram and Discord DMs**  
- **Twitter/X messages**  
- Fake “support” requests asking you to send crypto to solve issues

**Tips to Avoid Getting Tricked:**

- Never act under pressure. Scammers often create urgency.  
- Verify identities through **official channels**.  
- Avoid clicking links in DMs from unknown sources.  
- Always double-check any token sale or trade in [How to Track a Crypto Portfolio](/blog/getting-started/how-to-track-crypto-portfolio/).

## 5. Advanced Scam Examples

- **Rug Pulls in DeFi:** Developers abandon a project and drain liquidity, leaving investors with worthless tokens.  
- **Imposter Tokens:** Scammers create tokens mimicking popular coins or NFTs.  
- **Pump & Dump Schemes:** Coordinated hype artificially inflates token prices, then collapses the market.  
- **Malicious Smart Contracts:** Hidden functions allow hackers to steal funds even after legitimate transactions.

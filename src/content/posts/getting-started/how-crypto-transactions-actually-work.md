# How Crypto Transactions Actually Work: From Click to Confirmation

Sending crypto for the first time can feel like stepping into a black box. You click “send” and hope it arrives safely—but what’s really happening behind the scenes? Understanding this process will save you confusion, frustration, and even money.

---

## 1. The Journey of a Transaction

Every crypto transaction follows a similar path:

1. **You initiate the transaction** from your wallet.
2. **It enters the mempool**, where it waits to be confirmed.
3. **Miners or validators pick it up**, depending on the blockchain.
4. **Confirmations occur**, securing the transaction on-chain.
5. **It arrives at the recipient address**.

Think of it as mailing a letter. Your wallet is the post office, the mempool is the sorting facility, miners/validators are the delivery drivers, and confirmations are the signatures ensuring delivery.

> **Pro Tip:** Understanding mempools helps you predict delays and fee spikes. Learn more about [crypto fees explained](/blog/getting-started/crypto-fees-explained/).

## 2. Mempool: Where Transactions Wait

The mempool is essentially a waiting room for unconfirmed transactions. Every node keeps a copy, and miners/validators pick transactions from this pool.

- **Higher fees = faster inclusion**  
- **Low-fee transactions may get stuck** until congestion eases  
- **Monitoring mempools** can help you time high-priority transfers

---

## 3. Gas and Transaction Fees

Fees are essential. They incentivize validators to include your transaction in a block.

- **Ethereum:** Gas fees vary by network congestion. Use [wallets like Trust Wallet](/blog/getting-started/how-to-set-up-trust-wallet/) to estimate fees.  
- **Solana:** Typically lower and more predictable.  
- **Exchanges:** May charge extra withdrawal or conversion fees.  
- **Bridges and swaps:** Hidden slippage and liquidity costs may apply.

## 4. Confirmations: Why They Matter

Once a transaction is included in a block:

- **1 confirmation**: Usually enough for small transfers  
- **3–6 confirmations**: Recommended for large transfers  
- **Failed transactions**: Rare, but can happen if fees are too low or the network drops

---

## 5. Failed Transactions: What Went Wrong?

Reasons include:

- Insufficient gas  
- Smart contract errors  
- Network congestion  
- Wallet misconfigurations

## Week 1: Learn and Set Up Your Wallet

The first week is all about **building the foundation**. Before spending a single dollar:

### 1. Understand Custody

Decide whether you want a **custodial** wallet (managed by an exchange) or **non-custodial** (you control your private keys). Remember the mantra:

> *Not your keys, not your coins.*

### 2. Set Up Your First Wallet

Choose a beginner-friendly wallet like **Trust Wallet** or **MetaMask**. Follow a step-by-step setup tutorial:

- Secure your recovery phrase offline
- Enable extra security (PIN, biometrics)
- Start with small amounts

## Week 2: Buy Your First Crypto and Test Transfers

Week 2 is where you **experience your first real transactions** safely.

Buy a tiny amount first. Treat it as a **learning experiment**, not an investment. Example:

Move crypto between wallets or exchanges:

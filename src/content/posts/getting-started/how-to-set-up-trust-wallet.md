I first started using Trust Wallet in 2021, when I started trading bsc memecoins, and I even had friends who launched their own coins. I was having lots of fun in defi playing around on binance smart chain because the gas fee's were really cheap. I learned to trust Trust wallet. 

Trust Wallet is one of the most widely used mobile non-custodial wallets in 2026, trusted by millions of beginners and experienced users alike. It supports over 10 million assets across 100+ blockchains—including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, and many more—making it a true all-in-one solution.

Key features include built-in Web3 browser for dApps, direct token swaps, NFT management, staking for rewards, and easy crypto purchases. As a fully self-custodial wallet, you control your private keys and recovery phrase—no third party can access your funds.

This aligns perfectly with the self-custody principles in [What is Cryptocurrency?

### Prerequisites Before Starting

- A smartphone (iOS or Android)—Trust Wallet is mobile-first (no official browser extension).
- A private, quiet place to write down your recovery phrase.
- Paper and pen—never store the phrase digitally at first.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Trust Wallet

The setup takes just a few minutes.

#### Step 1: Download Trust Wallet from Official Sources

Always use official channels to avoid fake apps:

- **iOS**: App Store – Search "Trust: Crypto & Bitcoin Wallet" or visit https://apps.apple.com/app/trust-crypto-bitcoin-wallet/id1288339409
- **Android**: Google Play Store – Search "Trust Wallet" or visit https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wallet.crypto.trustapp

**Warning**: Only download from these links or the official site https://trustwallet.com. Fake apps on third-party stores can steal your funds.

#### Step 2: Install and Open the App

- Install the app and open it.
- You'll see the welcome screen with two main options: **Create a new wallet** or **I already have a wallet** (for importing).

#### Step 3: Create a New Wallet

- Tap **Create a new wallet**.
- Read and accept the terms (emphasizing self-custody responsibility).
- The app generates a **12-word secret recovery phrase**.
- **Write down the words exactly in order** on paper. Do not screenshot, type into notes, or share with anyone.
- Confirm by selecting the words in the correct sequence.

This phrase is your master key—if you lose your phone, it's the only way to recover your assets. Store it offline in a secure location.

#### Step 4: Secure Your Wallet

- Enable passcode (6-digit PIN) — required for extra protection.
- Turn on biometrics: Face ID (iOS) or fingerprint (Android) for quick, secure access.
- Trust Wallet encrypts everything locally—no data is sent to servers.

#### Step 5: Explore the Dashboard

- Your home screen shows total portfolio value and top assets.
- Use the search bar to add tokens or switch networks.
- Tap **Receive** to view addresses for any supported chain (e.g., BTC, ETH, SOL).

Trust Wallet automatically detects and supports most popular tokens.

#### Step 6: Fund Your Wallet (Optional Test)

To verify everything works:

- Use the **Buy** feature: Purchase crypto directly with credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank transfer (via trusted partners).
- Or transfer from an exchange using your Trust Wallet receive address.

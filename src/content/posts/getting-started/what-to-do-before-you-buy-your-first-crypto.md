# What to Do Before You Buy Your First Crypto

Buying your first crypto can be exciting, but jumping in without preparation is a common mistake beginners make. This guide walks you through **everything you need to do before your first purchase**, so you can enter the crypto world safely, confidently, and ready to explore even high-risk projects like memecoins.

## 1. Set Up Your Wallet Properly

Your wallet is the gateway to crypto. Choosing the right type and securing it properly is crucial.

- **Hot vs Cold Wallets:**  
  Hot wallets are online and convenient. Cold wallets are offline, safer from hacks. Learn more in our [Hot vs Cold Wallets guide](/blog/getting-started/cold-vs-hot-wallets-optimizing-security-and-eligibility/).

- **Recommended Beginner Wallets:**  
  Start with a trusted mobile wallet like [Trust Wallet](/blog/getting-started/how-to-set-up-trust-wallet/) to familiarize yourself with sending, receiving, and storing crypto.

- **Security Basics:**  
  - Back up your seed phrase offline.  
  - Enable two-factor authentication on any custodial account.  
  - Avoid sharing your private keys with anyone.

---

## 2. Understand Custody and KYC

Before buying, know **where and how your funds are stored**:

- **Custodial vs Non-Custodial:**  
  Custodial wallets (exchanges) hold your keys, making access easier but increasing risk. Non-custodial wallets put you in full control.  

- **KYC Requirements:**  
  Some exchanges require KYC (Know Your Customer) before buying. On-chain transactions usually do not. Understanding this reduces beginner anxiety.

- **Internal Links:**  
  For more about KYC and wallet control, see our article [Do I Need KYC to Use Crypto?](/blog/getting-started/do-i-need-kyc-to-use-crypto/).

## 3. Learn About Fees and Transactions

Knowing how transactions work prevents costly mistakes:

- **Transaction Basics:**  
  When you buy or send crypto, it goes through the network mempool, where miners or validators confirm it.  

- **Fees to Expect:**  
  - ETH gas fees  
  - Solana network fees  
  - Exchange and swap fees  

- **Confirmations:**  
  Transactions can fail if the network is congested or fees are too low. Check confirmations before assuming success.

---

## 4. Small Test Transactions

Before sending large amounts, practice with **tiny transactions**:

- Send a small amount to another wallet you control.  
- Observe network speed, fees, and confirmation times.  
- Confirm you can access and recover funds with your wallet backup.

---

## 5. Scam Awareness and Red Flags

Crypto scams are common, especially for beginners. Protect yourself by learning:

- **Phishing Links:** Never click unknown links.  
- **Fake Airdrops:** Only participate in verified programs.  
- **Approval Drainers:** Avoid giving unlimited approvals on tokens.

## 6. Mental Models: You Are Your Own Bank

Before purchasing crypto, internalize these concepts:

- You are fully responsible for security.  
- Loss of keys = loss of funds.  
- Every transaction is final on-chain.

This mindset will save you from panic and mistakes down the line.

## 7. Getting Ready for Memecoins: Extra Steps for High-Risk Projects

Memecoins can be exciting, but they come with unique risks. Before jumping in, here’s a beginner-friendly checklist to navigate safely:

### Step 1: Research the Project

- Check the token’s website, social media, and roadmap.  
- Look for **clear developer info** and community engagement.  
- Avoid coins with overly hyped or vague promises.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Wallets

- Use a **separate hot wallet** for memecoins to limit risk.  
- Consider having a small balance in your main wallet for core holdings.  
- Ensure your wallets are compatible with the blockchain the memecoin runs on (Solana, Ethereum, etc.).  

### Step 3: Use Tools to Stay Informed

- Tools can help track token launches, liquidity, and market caps.  
- We recommend starting with our curated [Crypto Tools Hub](/tools) for beginners.  
- These tools can help you monitor memecoin activity safely without exposing your main funds.

### Step 4: Test Small and Track Everything

- Make a **tiny first purchase** to understand the transaction process, fees, and confirmation times.  
- Record your transactions and balances to avoid confusion and keep track of gains or losses.

### Step 5: Mental Safety Net

- Only invest money you are comfortable losing — memecoins are highly volatile.  
- Avoid FOMO-driven buys from social media hype.  
- Treat these as experimental learning experiences, not guaranteed profits.

**Tip:** Following these steps protects your main holdings while giving you a safe path to explore memecoins. Over time, you’ll develop confidence and a repeatable system for evaluating high-risk tokens.

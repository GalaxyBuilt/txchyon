Bridging in crypto lets you transfer assets from one blockchain to another, typically to access lower fees, faster transactions, or specific dApps. In 2026, Ethereum mainnet can still get expensive during high activity, so beginners often bridge to Layer-2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum) or compatible chains (BNB Chain, Hyperliquid) for DeFi, gaming, NFTs, or trading.

Bridging locks your tokens on the source chain and mints an equivalent wrapped version on the destination. The process is secure when using official bridges, but always double-check URLs to avoid scams.

This guide builds on self-custody basics from [What is Cryptocurrency? A Complete Beginner's Guide to Blockchain in 2026](/what-is-cryptocurrency-beginners-guide-2026) and wallet setup tutorials. We'll cover the safest, official methods for each chain—avoiding risky third-party bridges that have been hacked in the past.

### Prerequisites Before Bridging

- A wallet like MetaMask ([setup guide](/how-to-setup-metamask-wallet)), Rabby ([setup guide](/how-to-setup-rabby-wallet)), or Trust Wallet ([setup guide](/how-to-setup-trust-wallet)).
- ETH on Ethereum mainnet for gas fees (and the asset you want to bridge).
- Add the destination network to your wallet (guides below include RPC details).
- Start with small amounts to test.

Always verify bridge URLs from official docs—phishing sites steal funds instantly.

### 1. Bridging from Ethereum to Polygon (Polygon PoS)

Polygon PoS is a popular sidechain with near-instant transactions and sub-cent fees.

**Official Bridge**: Polygon Portal (formerly Polygon Bridge)

#### Steps:
1. Go to https://portal.polygon.technology
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask/Rabby) and ensure you're on Ethereum Mainnet.
3. Select the token (ETH → MATIC, USDC, USDT, etc.).
4. Enter amount and approve the transaction (pays Ethereum gas).
5. Confirm the deposit—funds are locked on Ethereum.
6. Wait 7-20 minutes for the bridge to process.
7. Claim on Polygon (or it auto-claims in newer versions).

**Add Polygon Network** (if not already):
- Network Name: Polygon Mainnet
- RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com
- Chain ID: 137
- Currency: MATIC
- Block Explorer: https://polygonscan.com

Funds appear as MATIC (for ETH) or the same token on Polygon. Reverse bridging takes ~3 hours for security.

### 2. Bridging from Ethereum to Arbitrum

Arbitrum is a leading optimistic Layer-2 with EVM compatibility and very low fees.

**Official Bridge**: https://bridge.arbitrum.io

#### Steps:
1. Visit https://bridge.arbitrum.io
2. Connect wallet on Ethereum Mainnet.
3. Choose token (ETH, USDC, etc.) and amount.
4. Approve and deposit (Ethereum gas fee).
5. Wait ~10 minutes for the transaction to be processed on Arbitrum.
6. Funds automatically appear in your wallet on Arbitrum (same address).

**Add Arbitrum One Network**:
- Network Name: Arbitrum One
- RPC URL: https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
- Chain ID: 42161
- Currency: ETH
- Explorer: https://arbiscan.io

Withdrawal back to Ethereum takes 7 days (challenge period for security)—plan ahead.

### 3. Bridging from Ethereum to BNB Chain (Binance Smart Chain)

BNB Chain is an EVM-compatible chain popular for low-cost DeFi and gaming.

**Official Bridge**: https://www.binance.org/en/bridge (or use the updated BNB Chain Portal)

In 2026, the most trusted path is via the official BNB Bridge or core Binance integration.

#### Recommended Safe Method (via Binance if you have an account) or Official Bridge:
1. Visit https://www.bnbchain.org/en/bridge
2. Connect wallet.
3. Select direction: Ethereum → BNB Chain.
4. Choose asset and amount.
5. Approve and confirm deposit.
6. Wait 10-30 minutes for processing.

**Add BNB Chain Network**:
- Network Name: BNB Smart Chain
- RPC URL: https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org
- Chain ID: 56
- Currency: BNB
- Explorer: https://bscscan.com

Note: Some assets may require using specific cross-chain tools like Anyswap or Multichain for certain tokens, but stick to official for ETH/ERC-20.

### 4. Bridging from Ethereum to Hyperliquid

Hyperliquid is a high-performance Layer-1 (originally a perp DEX chain) that gained popularity in 2025 for fast trading and low latency. It uses its own bridging mechanism.

**Official Bridge**: https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/bridge

#### Steps:
1. Visit https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/bridge
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet.
3. Select deposit (Ethereum → Hyperliquid).
4. Choose USDC or ETH (most supported).
5. Enter amount, approve, and confirm.
6. Funds typically arrive in under 5 minutes.

**Add Hyperliquid Network** (if needed for viewing):
Hyperliquid assets usually appear directly in their app wallet interface—no custom RPC needed for basic use.

Withdrawal is similarly fast.

### General Tips and Security Best Practices

- **Use Official Bridges Only**: Third-party bridges (e.g., older Multichain, Wormhole hacks) have lost billions—stick to chain-native ones.
- **Check Gas and Timing**: Ethereum gas can spike; use tools like etherscan.io/gas to time deposits.
- **Same Wallet Address**: Most EVM chains use your same address—assets appear automatically after bridging.
- **Reverse Bridging**: Always possible, but may have delays (e.g., 7 days for Arbitrum).
- **Common Tokens**: ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI bridge most reliably.
- **Avoid Scams**: Never approve unlimited spends from unknown sites.

For wallet connections, Rabby Wallet often provides the best security with transaction simulation.

### Why Bridge at All?

- Save on fees (Ethereum $10-50 vs cents on L2s).
- Access exclusive dApps (e.g., cheaper NFT mints on Polygon, perps on Hyperliquid).
- Faster confirmations for trading or gaming.

Once bridged, explore DeFi safely—start small and learn from [Crypto Investing Psychology: Mastering Emotions and Avoiding FOMO as a Beginner in 2026](/crypto-investing-psychology-beginners-2026).

Bridging is a core skill for multi-chain crypto life in 2026. Practice with $20-50 first, then scale up. Safe travels across chains!

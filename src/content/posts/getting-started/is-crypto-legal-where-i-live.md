## Understanding Crypto Legality: A Beginner’s Perspective

When people talk about crypto being “legal,” they usually mean three things:

1. **Owning crypto is allowed** – you can hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other coins in a wallet.  
2. **Trading crypto is allowed** – buying or selling on exchanges is permitted.  
3. **Using crypto as payment** – spending crypto for goods or services may be regulated or restricted.  

Even if crypto is legal, governments may require you to **declare holdings for taxes**, follow KYC rules on exchanges, or restrict usage in payments. But don’t worry — most beginners only need to worry about **ownership and first purchases**, and that’s generally straightforward.

## Countries With Partial or Limited Crypto Use

Some countries allow crypto ownership but **restrict certain uses** like trading or payments. Here are examples:

- **India** – Crypto is legal, but banks may restrict transactions. Taxes on gains apply.  
- **China** – Trading and exchanges are banned, but private holdings are not illegal.  
- **Russia** – Ownership allowed, but spending crypto as payment is restricted.

A small group of countries has banned crypto outright:

- **Algeria, Morocco, Bangladesh** – Buying, selling, or using crypto is prohibited.

## On-Ramps vs On-Chain Usage

Understanding **how you interact with crypto** is essential:

- **On-Ramps**: Buying crypto with fiat currency through exchanges. KYC usually required.  
- **On-Chain Usage**: Sending, receiving, or staking crypto on blockchain networks. Non-custodial wallets make this legal in most regions.

Example: Maria in Mexico wants to buy Bitcoin. Using an exchange like Bitso (with KYC) is legal and regulated. Once she moves her Bitcoin to her personal wallet, she can use it on-chain safely without further registration.

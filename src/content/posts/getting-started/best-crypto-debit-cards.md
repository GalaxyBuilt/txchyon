## Why Crypto Debit Cards Still Matter in 2026

Crypto debit cards let you bridge the gap between digital assets and everyday spending. They allow users to:

- Spend crypto directly or via automatic conversion to fiat  
- Earn rewards (cashback or token-based) on daily purchases  
- Use the card globally, online and in-store, like a traditional debit card  

For beginners, these cards provide convenience, real-world utility, and a way to earn while spending crypto.

- **Regional availability** — some cards are restricted to certain countries  
- **Custody or staking requirements** — some cards require holding or staking their native token  
- **Fees and limits** — monthly/annual fees, conversion rates, or cashback caps  
- **Reward type** — stablecoin vs token rewards (volatility considerations)
